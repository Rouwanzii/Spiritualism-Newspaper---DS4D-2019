       "'A f^ECOF^D Of THE PROQREgf Of THE gCIEfICE /ND ETHICg OF gPIF^ITU/iUgM.\\nNo. 10.—Vol. I. LONDON : WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15, 1870. mon^PriS, Thr^n^r617\\nDR. NEWTON’S HEALING MEDIUMSHIP.\\nDr. J. R. Newton, the healing medium, was horn in\\nNewport, Rhode Island, United States, September 8th,\\n1810, consequently he is now about sixty years of age,\\nand it was eleven years and a half ago when he first\\nbegan to devote the whole of his time to the healing of\\nthe sick. In his lifetime he has passed through many\\nchanges and sorrows, and has both made and lost\\nseveral fortunes. He has often been in great danger\\nof losing his life. When he was eight years old, a\\nplaymate gave him a push one day as he was whittling\\nwith a knife; he fell, and the blade of the knife went\\ninto his breast right up to the handle, but he recovered\\nfrom the effects of this accident. At the age of ten he\\nfell from a tree, and was so much injured that his lower\\nlimbs were paralysed, and he could only draw himself\\nalong the ground by his arms; he recovered from this\\nstate in a single night, he believes in consequence of\\nthe healing ministrations of his unseen friends, the\\nspirits. When about eighteen years of age he fell from\\nthe masthead of a vessel, but he was caught in the\\nrigging, near the deck. At the age of nineteen, he,\\nwith seven other sailors, was out at sea upon a wreck\\nfor thirty-six days, yet they were saved. Since he has\\nworked as a healing medium, he has often been in\\ndanger from mobs in different cities in America, before\\nSpiritualism began to be understood there, and once at\\nHavana in Cuba, the crowds were so large, and some\\namong the people so antagonistic, that a file of soldiers\\nwas brought out to keep order.\\nThe last number of this journal contained an account\\nof the public reception given to Dr. J. R. Newton, on\\nthe 12th May, directly after his arrival in London.\\nOn the following day he hired the Cambridge Hall,\\nNewman-street, Oxford-street, for a week, and at the\\nCavendish Rooms, on Sunday evening, May 15th, after\\nthe close of the lecture by Mr. Peebles, he announced\\nthat every morning during the coming week he would\\nbo at the Cambridge Hall from nine till twelve o’clock,\\nfor • the purpose of healing as many of the sick as he\\ncould, without any charge either for admission, or for\\ncure of disease.\\nAs no bills were printed, nor anything beyond this\\nverbal announcement made, the attendance at Cam¬\\nbridge Hall during the next three mornings was rather\\nthin, and the few Spiritualists who knew of the work\\nhe was doing there, attended, and had many of their\\nailments cured. As will be seen by the list of a portion\\nof. the cures effected which is included in this article,\\nsome, of the results of his work were very wonderful,\\nand as the friends and neighbours of those relieved\\nsaw what remarkable things were being done, they also\\nbegan to attend in large numbers. On Thursday, May\\n19th, some of the newspapers began to abuse and mis¬\\nrepresent Dr. Newton, calling him a “ professed miracle\\nworker,” which he is not, and this tended to increase\\nthe number of observers to such an extent, that on\\nSaturday the inside of the hall was completely\\nblockaded, and Dr. Newton had to give up attendance\\nthere, to search for a larger building. He tried for a\\nweek to get a larger hall, but was unsuccessful, in con¬\\nsequence of the untruthful reports about him in the\\nLondon daily papers. On Sunday, May 29th, he went\\nto [Swindon, Wiltshire, to heal the sick, and some of\\nthe metropolitan newspapers printed false statements\\nthat he had found it judicious to run away from\\nLondon. On Tuesday, May 31st, he returned to town,\\nand because of the difficulty of getting a hall on any\\nterms, in which to execute his work, ho gave notice\\nthat he would heal the sick, free of charge, in the\\nLondon Fields, Hackney, but as ho was afterwards in¬\\nformed that if he did so he would be in danger of being\\narrested, he did not think it worth while to run the risk\\nby attending. From Friday, June 3rd, he has been\\nhealing the sick daily, Sundays excepted, free of charge,\\nfrom ten till twelve o’clock, at “ The Repository,”\\nGray’s-inn-road.\\nTo the intelligent reader it is scarcely necessary to\\nstate that we disown miracles of every kind in connec¬\\ntion with Spiritualism, and assert, that so far as our\\nexperience goes, the marvellous manifestations witnessed\\nat spiritual seances are produced by the aid of natural\\nlaws, wielded by disembodied human beings who are\\nliable to error, but who are in a state of life where they\\nare surrounded by phenomena which are as high above\\nthose of the animal world, as the phenomena of the\\nanimal world are above those of the mineral kingdom.\\nAll through the history of mesmerism will be found\\ncases of wonderful cures effected by its aid. The late\\nDr. Elliottson recorded a vast number of authenticated\\ncases of cures by mesmerism in his periodical called\\nThe Zoist, and he was much persecuted by his brother\\nphysicians for telling the truth on this subject. Dr.\\nNewton is naturally a good mesmerist, but he is also\\na powerful medium and a Spiritualist; he, therefore,\\nhas some of the powers of Spiritualism superadded to\\nthose of mesmerism. He cures some people, relieves\\nothers, and fails with the remainder. From observa¬\\ntion we think that his cures by laying on of hands are\\nproduced partly by the mesmeric effects of his own\\nwill-power, but partly, and perhaps chiefly, by the aid\\nof disembodied spirits. There is no miracle; he has\\nnever claimed the power of working miracles, nor have\\nhis friends done so for him.\\nNow as to his method of working. A few friends\\nkeep a clear space near him as well as they can, and\\none by one those who are afflicted come under his\\nhands; he finishes off most cases in one or two minutes,\\nbut some of them require his attention for five or more\\nminutes. He talks little, but lays his hands on the\\nafflicted parts, sometimes with a short invocation, some¬\\nthing like this—“ May the Almighty Father and His\\nholy angels pour out their love upon this afflicted one,\\nand remove his disease from him. Be healed! You\\nare well!” When a person comes up to him, in many\\ncases without the interchange of a word, he lays his\\nhands on the seat of the disease, and says what is the\\nmatter; he also tells some of them at once that they\\nare incurable; others, he remarks, he can cure at once,\\nand he tells some that he will partially relieve them\\nat once, but that they will be well within a given\\nnumber of days. Some come Up to him, and he does\\nnot know what is the matter with them, but asks them\\nthe nature of their complaint. Others consult him\\nabout sick friends at a distance, and in some cases he\\nsuddenly stops the speaker, and accurately describes to\\nhim or her the sick friend. With respect to the clair¬\\nvoyant powers already mentioned, which are occa¬\\nsionally exhibited by Dr. Newton, in one instance at\\nthe Cambridge Hall, he said:—“ Your sick friend has a\\nyellow sallow complexion, as if he had had the jaundice,\\nand he has bushy black whiskers ; I dare say you won¬\\nder how I know this, and I can hardly tell you myself,\\nbut I see him by a kind of clairvoyance, reflected, I\\nsuppose, from some image in your brain.” But another\\ncase occurred on the Wednesday morning that Dr.\\nNewton was healing the sick in Cambridge Hall, when\\na lady told him that her son was ill at home with\\ndiseased lungs, and Dr. Newton said, “ I can relieve\\nhim; I will make him get right; up, and he feels a shock\\npassing through him at this moment. Now he says,\\n‘ I’m going to get up? and he coughs and breathes\\nfreely.” This was at 11.10 a.m. We inquired this\\nlady’s name and address, which- she does not desire\\nshould be published, and went to her residence at\\nDalston, to learn what actually took place in the sick\\nroom, while she was at Cambridge Hall. The patient\\nhad felt no shock, and was not perceptibly better,, but\\nhe had made some casual remarks to the servant about\\nan inclination to get up. This case then furnishes an\\ninstance of the unreliability of clairvoyance, and expe¬\\nrienced Spiritualists know that the reliability of clair¬\\nvoyant manifestations, is apt to vary even with the\\nsame medium. In the American papers there are\\nseveral narratives of Dr. Newton having healed the\\nsick while at a distance from the patient. In the two\\ncases of Dr. Newton’s clairvoyance just mentioned, it\\nwill be noticed that the conditions were not the same,\\nfor in the successful instance what he saw was in the\\nbrain of the person speaking to him, but in the failure\\nsuch knowledge was not in the mind of the lady to\\nwhom he was speaking.\\nEach person, after passing under the hands of Dr.\\nNewton, mixes with the crowd, and is soon surrounded\\nby a knot of questioners, among whom he is soon lost to\\nview. Almost the only way to get at the facts about\\nthe cures effected by Dr. Newton in public, is to stop\\nthese persons then and there, and take down their\\ncases from their own lips. Our reporter spent two\\nmornings at this work in the Cambridge Hall, and\\nfound that Dr. Newton got through his work so expe¬\\nditiously that there was no time to question more than\\nabout one in every six of the sick persons who passed\\nunder his hands. Among those who were thus ques¬\\ntioned, some were found to be in a nervous state, but\\nnot perceptibly better than before they passed under\\nthe hands of Dr. Newton; some were three-parts cured\\nand in great joy thereat; and the remainder, amount¬\\ning perhaps to one-fifth of the total number questioned,\\nhad been cured on the spot, in a most marvellous man¬\\nner, of such things as blindness, lameness, paralysis, and\\nafflictions which orthodox doctors had been unable to\\nrelieve. A list of some of these cases, with the names\\nand addresses of the patients, is given further on.\\nBlindness, when cured, was usually completely cured\\non the spot, with such suddenness as to coincide with\\nthe popular ideas of a miracle. Lameness, when cured,\\nwas usually so removed that the patient could carry his\\ncrutches away on his shoulders ; but there was, as a\\nrule, a weakness in the gait, which Dr. Newton often\\nremarked would pass off in two or three days. In\\none instance, a little boy, rolled up like a ball in his\\nmother’s arms, and having an idiotic expression of face,\\nwas brought under the notice of the healer. Dr. New¬\\nton at once remarked—“ This child is what in old times\\nwas called possessed by devils, but 1 will drive away\\nthe evil influences so that they shall annoy him no\\nmore.” He then made some passes over the child,\\nwhose limbs then slowly extended themselves, until at\\nlast they stood out straight. Dr. Newton then took his\\nhands, and said, “ Come now, walk my little darling,”\\nbut although the legs were straight, they doubled up at\\nthe knees, in consequence of weakness there, and the\\nchild not knowing how to walk. Dr. Newton told his\\nmother to take him home, to apply water as hot as he\\ncould bear it once a day to his back, and added that in\\na few days the boy would be quite well, and must be\\ntaught to walk.\\nDr. Newton is a man of action and of few words, and\\nit is only now and then, while doing his work, that he\\nmakes a few remarks. In those remarks he often stated\\nthat love is a positive substance, and that it is in con¬\\nsequence of the love which he bears to all mankind,\\nthat the spirits have the power to enable him to effect\\nhis marvellous cures; he also states that the love of\\nthose he has cured, as well as of others, strengthens\\nhis healing powers wherever he may be. He cannot\\ncure anybody who comes to him in a state of mind\\nantagonistic to him and his work. He says that a\\ngreat number of bright and glorious spirits are helping\\nhim in his work, and that among them is Jesus Him¬\\nself, who like the others is progressing in love and\\nwisdom, and says that were He to return to earth-life\\nagain with His present knowledge, He would never use\\nsuch harsh words as “ 0 generation of vipers!” to any\\nof His fellow creatures.\\nLIST OF SOME OF DR. NEWTON’S CURES.\\nThe following list of twenty-three cases, was made\\nup on the mornings of the 18th and 19th May, in the\\nCambridge Hall, by our reporter, who took down the\\nstatements here given, from the lips of the persons\\nbenefitted:—\\n1. Charles Clutterbuck, 33, Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane,\\nlame, and when he came to the hall could not walk a step\\nwithout the aid of a stick. Cured on the spot, and pains\\nremoved.\\n2.

Relieved at once\\nby Dr. Newton of indigestion, pains in chest and head, and\\nweakness of eyes of long standing.\\n21. Edward Jones, painter and glazier, 1, Wellington-street,\\nShacklewell, Kingsland. Afflicted with rheumatic gout since\\nChristmas, and could not bend his limbs. After treatment by\\nDr. Newton for a few minutes, the swellings went out of his\\nfeet, and he could bend his limbs freely. He said that Dr.\\nForman, of Stoke Newington-road, a gentleman much re¬\\nspected in the locality, and a clever man, knew his case.\\nThe two following cases have previously been pub¬\\nlished in this journal:—\\n22. The Rev. F. Rowland Young, minister of the Free\\nChristian Church, Swindon, suffering from neuralgic affec¬\\ntions in the head for eleven years. Went from England to\\nRhode Island, United States, in 1868, on purpose to see Dr.\\nNewton, who cured him on the spot. No symptoms of the\\nreturn of the complaint since.\\n23. Mr. Ashley, retired merchant, 5, Catherine-street,\\nLiverpool. In rapid consumption, given over by the doctors,\\nand on Saturday, May 7th last, burst a blood-vessel. On\\nSunday, May 8th, Dr. Newton saw him, and in five or six\\nminutes brought him down stairs in such good condition\\nthat he attended a public meeting the same evening. Had\\nnot been out of his bed for five months previously, next day\\nwas able to walk out, to eat a meat dinner, and to drink ale\\nwith it.\\nThe two next cases of cures effected by Dr. Newton,\\nsince bis arrival in London, have been supplied to us\\nby Mr. Benjamin Coleman, of 1, Bernard Yillas, Upper\\nNorwood, in a letter dated May 18th, 1870 :—\\n24. Edwin Cowper, 16 years of age, son of Mr. Frederick\\nCowper, 388, Edgeware-road, saw Dr. Newton, for the first\\ntime, on Sunday last about five o’clock, at Cleveland Hall.\\nThe Doctor seeing that the boy was lame, asked “what was the\\nmatter.” The\\'mother told him the case, and said the boy had\\nbeen obliged to use crutches for the last five years. The Doc¬\\ntor straightened the boy’s leg, and made him stand on the fiat\\nof his foot ; and then, taking away the crutches, told him to\\nwalk away, he would never require them again. He did so,\\nand accompanied his mother to a friend’s house about three-\\nquarters of a mile distant, and in the evening walked another\\nthree-quarters of a mile. I saw the boy on the day following\\n—Monday the 16th May—and he was walking without\\ncrutches, and said he felt strong enough to walk further than on\\nthe previous day. The boy, Edwin Cowper, has been under\\nthe treatment and advice of Mr. Paget, Mr. Webb, Mr.\\nAdams, Mr. Hutton, and Dr. Stuart.”\\n25. “ I met at Dr. Newton’s first reception on Monday last\\nat Cambridge Hall, Mr. George Pulsford. of 4. Yernon-square.\\nKing’s Cross-road, who had just been operated upon for deaf¬\\nness in his right ear. For fourteen years, he said he had lost\\nthe hearing of that ear, and was so deaf that he could not\\nhear a pistol shot, and he could now hear a whisper. I tested\\nhim by asking him after he had closed his left ear, if he heard\\nme, and though I spoke in the lowest tone of voice, he\\nanswered my question readily. These two cases can be relied\\nupon ” #Yours truly, B. Coleman.\\nThe following cases of cures effected by Dr. Newton\\nin the Free Christian Church, Swindon, on Sunday,\\nMay 29th, 1870, are extracted from ihv North Wilts\\nHerald, of the 4th of this month; in some instances\\nwhere the North Wilts Herald gives only the name of\\nthe street in which the healed person lives, we have\\nadded the word “ Swindon,” assuming Swindon to be\\nmeant by the reporter :—\\n26.

Sight so bad\\nthat she could not recognise her own friends when six yards\\noff. Eyesight much improved; eyes had a warm sensation in\\nthem after Dr. Newton’s treatment.\\nThe following statements as to relief received from\\nDr. Newton’s treatment were taken down from the lips\\nof the patients, usually within a few minutes after they\\ncame from under bis hands, at “The Depository,”\\nGray’s-inn-road, on Thursday, June 9th. These cases,\\nas usual, were selected from many unsuccessful ones :—\\n63. Mrs. Breakspeare, 73, Cromer-street, Gray’s-inn-road.\\nHer baby, twelve months’ old, had curvature of the spine for\\nlast six months. The curvature entirely disappeared in one\\nminute, under the hands of Dr. Newton.\\n64. William Gage, 76, New Wellington-street, Holloway,\\nbricklayer. Numbness of muscles of arm and hand for six\\nweeks, so that he could not perform particular branches of his\\nwork. Cured at once.\\n65. John Pearson, 17, Leek-street, King’s-cross-road, tailor,\\nchronic rheumatics. Unable to work at his trade for last ten\\nyears. Perfectly cured at once.\\n66. W. Wallace, 105, Islip-street, Kentish-town-road. Severe\\ncase of rheumatics ; could not walk properly. Cured.\\n67. Charles Lenton, 20a, London-street, Paddington. Driver\\nof cab No. 4,828. Intense suffering from rheumatics for two\\nor three years, and had been under the hands of seven doctors.\\nCured at once, although he had been in incessant pain for\\nseveral days up to the minute of coming under Dr. Newton’s\\nhands.\\n68. Mrs. G. Way, 3, Circus-street, Marylebone-road. Painful\\nlump on knee, about as big as a nut, caused by a fall. Lump\\nand pain disappeared at once.\\nThe details of the following case will be found in our\\nreport of the farewell meeting to Mr. Peebles, printed\\nin another column :—\\n69. H. D. Jencken, barrister-at-law, Kilmorey House, Penge.\\nDefective vision of left eye. Cured.\\nThe following cases are reprinted from The Medium\\nnewspaper:—\\n70. Henry Teson, • 96, Milton-street, Finsbury, had been\\ngiven up by Dr. Walker as incurably lame. He was carried\\nin to Dr. Newton, and after treatment could walk without\\ncrutches.\\n71. Elizabeth Fowler, 5b, Bedford-street, Bedford-square,\\ncame with a large internal tumour; before she left Dr. New¬\\nton’s presence the swelling had considerably lessened, and she\\nexpressed herself much relieved.\\n72. Miss Shaw, 5, Cambridge-road, Junction, Kilburn,\\nwalked bent and lame from the effects of carrying a child\\nabout when a growing girl. Dr. Newton rectified the hip-\\njoint, making it snap. The cure progressed during the night\\nunder spirit influence, and next day she walked straight, and\\nher limb was half an inch longer than before.\\n73. H. Wooderson, “ King’s Arms,” Hampton Court, had\\nbeen afflicted with eczema since last autumn, has suffered\\nmuch and been under a deal of medical treatment with some\\nbenefit lately. He visited Dr. Newton at Cambridge Hall,\\nand is now active, vigorous and hearty, though nearly sixty\\nyears of age and seventeen stone weight.\\n74. Mr. Browning, Great Yarmouth-villas, College-avenue,\\nHackney, had a stiff knee from slipping off the curb ; a cancer\\non the left breast six to eight inches in breadth ; had been\\nfive months in bed, and paid from two to four guineas weekly\\nfor medical attendance. He was taken in a cart to Dr. Newton\\nat Cambridge Hall; the cancer burst the same evening; he has\\nbeen walking about since, has a good appetite, and is fast re¬\\ncovering health.\\n75. Mr. G. Richards, 58, Earl-street, Edgware-road, had\\nleft hand and arm paralysed for three years, was cured by Dr.\\nNewton at Grgy’s-inn-road; and is daily telling all who will\\nlisten to him.\\n76. Miss Mathew, 32a, New Church-street, Edgware-road,\\na member of Dr. Burns’ congregation, had her spine injured\\nby a railway accident, so that the bone was much displaced.\\nHad been under medical attendance for twelve months, and\\nhad to use a water bed for nine months. She went to Dr.\\nNewton’s house and had the spine rectified, and she can now\\nwalk about.\\n77. A most indisputable and astonishing cure was per¬\\nformed by Dr. Newton on the Rev. W. C. Van Meter, superin¬\\ntendent of the Howard Mission\\' and Home for Little\\nWanderers, New York, at the Progressive Library, 15, South¬\\nampton-row, on Tuesday morning. Mr. Van Meter gave an\\naccount of his case in the presence of Messrs. Jencken, Daw,\\nand other gentlemen, the same morning. He stated that on\\nJune 20, 1869, he stepped on a piece of orange-peel, which\\nthrew him down, and he broke two ligaments in his back. He\\nwas confined to bed for some time, and was under the medical\\ncare of Drs. Wood and Palmer, of New York. The best\\nmedical advice in that city could do nothing for him, and he\\nwas advised to go to Italy, to see whether the climate would\\nbenefit his general health, and promote a cure. He reached\\nParis, but was in such a weak state that he could not proceed\\nfurther. He put himself under the care of Dr. Ricard, who\\ndid him some good, and he was enabled to proceed .on his\\njourney to Lyons, Marseilles, and Nice, where he resided one\\nmonth. He determined to go to Naples, but got out at\\nGenoa, and proceeded to Florence, where he remained one\\nweek ; and to Rome, where he spent two weeks—all of which\\ntime he was under eminent medical treatment. He ultimately\\nreached Naples, but the climate was so bad that he left it and\\nwent to Sorento, then returned to Florence, where he suffered\\nmore than he had done at any period of his illness. He was\\nadvised to go to the German baths, and, after nine days’\\npainful travelling, he reached his destination. He took seven\\nbaths, which did him good ; he could walk with the assistance\\nof a cane. After he had taken seventeen baths, he left,\\nmuch better, and proceeded to Paris, where he had a relapse,\\nand again sought the advice of Dr. Lticard, who congratulated him\\non the general progress he bad made: recommended him to try\\nthe Turkish bath at Mr. Metcalf’s establishment, Paddington-\\ngreen, London ; and told him to be of good cheer, and that\\nafter a long time he might recover. He came to London on\\nFriday last, and took some hydropathic treatment at Mr.\\nMetcalfe’s establishment. It happened that he met with\\nMr. Cowper, of Edgware-road, whose son was so success¬\\nfully treated [Case 24], as stated in the last number of The\\nMedium. Mr. Cowper informed Mr. Van Meter of his son’s\\ncase ; but Mr. Van Meter said he did not believe a word\\nof it, and that it was all humbug. He had heard of Dr.\\nNewton in America, and of jiis having cured one of his\\nSunday-school attendants, but had never given the matter\\nany attention, having contented himself with entertaining\\nthe popular notion that the Doctor’s powers were of a delusive\\nnature. Some one said, “ The power proceeded from the\\ndevil,” and Mr. Van Meter replied, “ Hurrah for the devil,\\nthen, if he can do good at the rate which is reported of Dr.\\nNewton ! ” He was in doubts of being considered a fool for\\nconsulting Dr. Newton, and he determined on taking his\\nfriend, Dr. Smith, of Chicago, with him to see what took\\nplace. He accordingly came to the Progressive Library on\\nMonday afternoon, on his crutches, but could not see Dr\".\\nNewton, who afterwards met with him, and made an appoint¬\\nment for Tuesday morning at ten o’clock. Mr. Van Meter\\nand Dr. Smith were punctual in attendance. The patient\\nhad walked with great difficulty from Euston-square, on his\\ncrutches, to Southampton-row — the lameness being caused\\nby paralysis of the lower extremities proceeding from pres¬\\nsure of the last joint of the back upon the spinal cord,\\nwhich caused him great pain, as well as unfitted him for\\nwalking, except with great difficulty on two crutches. One\\nof his legs was drawn up. Dr. Newton soon arrived, and\\nJune 15, 1870.\\nTHE SPIRITUALIST.\\n75\\nMr. Van Meter was about to describe his case, but the doctor\\nimmediately stopped him, and placed his hand on his spine,\\nenabling him to walk at once as well as he had ever done in\\nin his life. He ran up and down stairs with ease and\\npleasure ; went round to Euston and Tavistock-squares;\\nvisited various charitable institutions, and was now com¬\\npletely recovered from his painful illness. This narrative was\\ngiven about two hours after the cure was performed. From\\nthe patient’s statements we infer that he had despaired of ever\\ngetting cured, and, at some period of his sufferings considered\\nhimself a dead man. He is now residing at 60, Euston-\\nsquare, and is ready to attest the truthfulness of this state¬\\nment. The crutches were left at the Progressive Library.\\nMr. Van Meter is, perhaps, the most eminent philanthropist in\\nAmerica. He is the Muller of the United States. He has\\nreceived thousands of orphan children and little wanderers\\ninto his family, and does an immense deal of good. He is\\nbusily engaged in London in discovering the methods of pro¬\\nmoting human happiness at work in that city. He is a large\\npowerful man, full of true humanity, good nature, and love to\\nall, especially to little children.\\nLast Monday the following statements of relief were\\ntaken down by our reporter at The depository, Gray’s-\\ninn-road:—\\n78. James Morgan, 21, Warwick-square, City, E.C., age 49\\ntailor. Chronic rheumatics for last five years, and could not\\nwalk without the aid of two sticks. Pains removed by Dr.\\nNewton, and can walk easily with one stick, which he could\\nnot do before.\\n79. Ann Nicholson, 36, Liverpool-road, Islington. Wind\\nand swellings in chest for more than a year, and often in\\ndanger of losing her life from the same. Cured, and hopes\\nshe will have no return of the ailment. •\\n80. George Huckle, 18, Great James-street, Bedford-row,\\nbuilder. Bad for five years with what the doctors told him\\nwas chronic sciatica of the hip joint. For last two years\\ncould only walk with difficulty by the aid of a stick. Was\\nquite cured last Friday, and no symptoms of return of pains\\nsince. Is a Conservative and a reader of the Standard news¬\\npaper, and feels highly indignant at the misrepresentations\\nof Dr. Newton, published in that paper last Saturday.\\n81. Harriett Morgan, 21, Warwick-square, City, E.C.\\nSubject to epileptic fits about once in a fortnight. Has had no\\nfit for the past month, and saw Dr. Newton a fortnight ago\\nwhen another attack was due.\\n82. Sarah Chatman, 3, Bandall’s cottages, Vork-road,\\nKing’s-cross. Nearly blind of both eyes. Can now see very\\nmuch better and clearer, but eyes still weak.\\n83. Mary Ann Smith, 22, Gray’s-inn-lane, japanner. Burnt\\nin face by a gas-flame two years ago, and eyes bad ever since.\\nEyesight much improved and strengthened by Dr. Newton.\\nCould not see anybody’s features across the street before, but\\nnow can do so with ease.\\n84. J. S. Steele, 36, Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell,\\nwatchmaker, and member of the St. John’s Association of\\nSpiritualists. Knee-cap fixed by an accident, and could get\\nto Cambridge Hall three weeks ago, only with much difficulty\\nand pain. Was then cured by Dr. Newton, and made better\\nin health generally. No return of pains since.\\n85. Isaac Pentecost, 10, York-hill, PentonvBle-road. Rheu¬\\nmatic gout and cold spasms. Could hardly breathe before\\ncoming under Dr. Newton’s hands. Now does so easily, feels\\nhis rheumatic pains slightly, and hopes that the relief is per¬\\nmanent.\\n86. Sarah Cole, 25, War burton-road, London-fields. Nearly\\nblind of both eyes ; could not see to read, and could just see\\nenough to be able to dress her children. Can now read the\\nnewspaper. This \\'statement was confirmed on the spot by\\nsomebody who gave her a newspaper to read.\\n87. William Ellis, 4, Phoenix-place, Mount-pleasant, Clerken¬\\nwell. Chronic rheumatics and lameness; First came under\\nDr. Newton’s hands last Friday. Rheumatic pains removed,\\nand some of his lamenesss, but still obliged to use crutches.\\nFeels gradual improvement.\\n88. Peter Mcfarlane, 21, Clinger-street, Hoxton, managing\\nclerk to an attorney. Three parts cured by Dr. Newton, of\\ndeafness of the right ear of some months standing.\\n89. Charles Barnes, 116, Pentonville-hill, cook. Deafness\\nof left ear for five years, and rheumatics for’ one year. Deaf¬\\nness cured. Rheumatics partially cured.\\n90. John Smith, 15, Little Coram-street, Bloomsbury, car¬\\nman. Defective sight—an apparent mist before the eyes,\\nconcealing distant objects for last six months. Eyes now\\nvery much better, and can see to read, which he could not do\\nbefore, but not quite cured.\\n91. Henry Bennett, 61, Compton-street, Burton-crescent.\\nWeakness of eyes and imperfect sight. Cured.\\nThe preceding cases, as usual, were selected from\\nmany wherein no apparent benefit had been derived,\\nbut one boy in the crowd, said that his eyes had been\\nmade worse by Dr. Newton’s treatment. He gave us\\nthe address, “ William Radcliffe, 33, Liverpool-street,\\nKing’s-cross-road.” He had weak eyes, and had been\\nunder Dr. Newton’s hands four times. As it was the\\nonly case we have met wherein anybody said they felt\\nthe worse for treatment, the boy was cross-questioned,\\nand said that he did not notice any difference in his\\neyesight, but his friends told him that the lower eye¬\\nlid of his left eye was more swollen than it was before,\\nand he thought so too. His companions remarked that\\ncures had been taken down for publication, so this case\\nought to be taken down as well, and the assurance that\\nit would be done seemed to give great satisfaction to the\\nyouths assembled.\\nOn Sunday, June 5th, Dr. Newton and Mr. Peebles\\nvisited Nottingham. Dr. Newton was fatigued with\\nhis journey, and was less successful at Nottingham in\\nhealing diseases than usual, but the following cases\\nare published in the Nottingham Journal of June 6th,\\n1870:—\\n92. Joseph Cresswell, 7, Hedderley-street, Nottingham.\\nRheumatism. Obliged to walk with sticks or crutches.\\nCured.\\n93. George Hackett, 46, Mansfield-road, Nottingham.\\nInjured by fall some years ago, and obliged to walk with\\ncrutches. Cured so as to walk without crutches.\\n94. Charles Ringrose, Castleditch, Carnarvon, North Wales.\\nCame to Nottingham to see Dr. Newton. Dislocated hip,\\nnecessitating use of crutch. Cured, but could not walk quite\\nfreely.\\n95. Eliza Billington, 12, Bullivant-street, Nottingham,\\nJane Mayhood, South-street, Nottingham, Mrs. Wales, Pierre-\\npont-street, Nottingham, and a host of others suffering from\\ncomplaints, declared themselves benefitted, though* many\\nreceived no relief at all.\\nThe following cases were collected yesterday by our\\nreporter at the Eepository, Gray’s-inn-road, when he\\nlooked in upon Dr. Newton at his work for half-an-\\nhour:—\\n96. W. H. Tucker, age 35, 2, Augusta-terrace, York-road,\\nKing’s-cross, porter on Great Northern Railway. Chest in¬\\njured by accident; jammed between buffers of railway trucks.\\nHad done no work for last eight months. Could scarcely speak,\\nand only make people hear with difficulty. Relieved at once\\nby Dr. Newton, so as to be able to converse easily, but voice\\nnot quite restored as yet.\\n97. George Wright, 10, Charlotte-place, Paddington, W.,\\nage 36, hassock-maker. Gall stones about three months, and\\nyellow in face in consequence. Came under Dr. Newton’s\\nhand three weeks ago. Cured, and returned yesterday to\\nthank him.\\n98. A. Bishop, 20, Canterbury-road, Maida-vale, commercial\\ntraveller. Hard lump under knee for seven years, interfering\\nwith his walking. Lump now soft and can walk better;\\nthinks it is going away.\\n99. Maria Mordle, 71, Willow-walk, Bermondsey. Total\\ndeafness of right ear for two years. Cured.\\n100. Amy Kiddeoo, 19, Willow-walk, Bermondsey. Rheu¬\\nmatic gout in feet and hands, of several years’ standing.\\nCured by Dr. Newton. Had previously been to great expense\\nfor medical attendance.\\n101. John Palmer, 285, Gray’s-inn-road, refreshment-house¬\\nkeeper. Deaf of left ear for twenty-five years. Cured.\\n102. Emma Ansell, 5, Compton-place, King’s-cross, St. Pan-\\neras. A little girl. Pains in chest; much relieved by Dr.\\nNewton, and|mother benefitted in health.\\n103. Michael Kelly, 2, Market-street, John-street-road,\\nlabouring builder. Rheumatics in hands, feet, and knees, for\\nthree months. Could scarcely walk before passing under Dr.\\nNewton’s hands. Cured.\\n104. James Burrus, 19, Phillip’s-buiidings, Somers-town,\\nlocksmith and bellhanger. Ulcer wounds on ankle, and lame\\nfor last two years. Could only hobble by the aid of a stick,\\nbut directly after he passed under Dr. Newton’s hands, found\\nthat he could walk without stick, and was a changed man in\\nhealth. Has since been a wonder both to himself and his\\nneighbours.\\n105. Richard Cearney, 14, Ashby-street, King’s-cross, gas-\\nfactory labourer at the Imperial Gas Works. Rheumatics in\\narms and legs. Three parts cured by Dr. Newton.\\nSucli are a few of the cures performed by Dr. Newton,\\nand they probably do not amount to one-twentieth of\\nthe total number effected by him within the last four\\nweeks. Since he-landed in England, he must have\\ngreatly alleviated the sufferings of more than a thou¬\\nsand persons. The Daily Telegraph, in an article on\\nthe subject, gave its readers the following inaccurate\\ninformation:—-“ The man must be stopped—by public\\nopinion, if he is a mere crazy visionary ; by Scotland-\\nyard, if be is a rogue. We have had, of recent times,\\ntoo many Yankee tricks in which there has rarely failed\\nto be a strong infusion of disgusting blasphemy. Such\\njugglers have pandered long enough to the vanity and\\ncredulity of the fools in society. They have brought\\nabout quite enough of madness and misery in private\\nlife; and there is a latent inference of Spiritualism in\\nthe spurious prodigies of ‘ Doctor ’ Newton. He has\\nCUBED HO BEAL AILMENT; HE IS OBVIOUSLV POWERLESS,\\nBY THE MIRACULOUS MEANS HE HAS THE AUDACITY TO\\nINVOKE, TO REMOVE A CHILBLAIN OR A BUNION. His\\nappearance under the scandalous circumstances of last\\nweek’s exhibition is at once an insult to the civilisation\\nof the age, and a humiliating proof that—notwith¬\\nstanding all our boasted enlightenment—a vast num^\\nber of persons remain as grossly credulous, as idiotically\\nsuperstitious, as the African idolaters who bow down be¬\\nfore fetishes and worship Mumbo-Jumbo.” The largest\\namount of misrepresentation of Dr. Newton was pub¬\\nlished in the Daily Telegraph and the Echo, the said\\nmisrepresentation being calculated to interfere with the\\npersonal safety of Dr. Newton, by rousing the passions\\nand prejudices of an uninformed mob. In all the worst\\nnewspaper attacks upon Dr. Newton, the writers were\\nobliged to suppress what they knew well, namely, that\\nDr. Newton made no charge for healing rich or poor,\\nbecause had they inserted this item of truth, it would\\nhave spoilt the whole of every article calling him a\\nswindler and an impostor. The Daily News had a\\ntolerably fair article on the proceedings at Cambridge\\nHall, considering that it was written from a prejudiced\\npoint of view, and that the author did not trouble him¬\\nself to investigate the cases of cure coming under his\\nnotice, by taking down the particulars from the lips of\\neach patient. It is utterly impossible for an observer\\nstanding with his hands in his pockets, watching Dr.\\nNewton at his work, to get an accurate ideas of what is\\nreally taking place. Thus, at Cambridge Hall a woman\\nwent up to Dr. Newton on crutches, and after treat¬\\nment by him, walked away with her crutches over her\\nshoulder, amid tremendous applause from all observers.\\nOur reporter took her aside and questioned her; she\\nwas in a very nervous state, and said that she was able\\nto walk a little without crutches before passing under\\nDr. Newton’s hands; also she did not know whether\\nhe had given her any relief or not. On the other hand,\\nsome persons passed under the Doctor’s hands for a\\nminute, and were then lost in the crowd, without the\\nobservers knowing what was the matter with them, or\\nwhat had been done; yet on questioning some of these\\npatients, our reporter found cases where in the one\\nshort minute, they had been cured of blindness, or some\\nother serious ailment. Now and then Dr. Newtou tells\\nthe crowd the nature of a remarkable cure just effected,\\nand makes the patient speak out to confirm it, but this\\nis very rarely done, because he is usually too\\nbusy about his work. Hence observers cannot\\ngain accurate knowledge of what takes place when\\nthey simply look on and do not investigate. This\\nwill explain why all reports drawn up by people\\nwho merely lounge in and out of the building must\\nof necessity be to some extent unreliable, apart from\\nthose instances of very gross abuse, showered down\\nupon the head of Dr. Newton by some of the journa¬\\nlists. It is a remarkable thing that although Dr.\\nNewton has left family, friends, and a luxurious\\nhome although he has crossed the Atlantic, taken a\\nlarge house on Haverstock-hill, and hired public halls\\nto heal the sick; although he has done all this at very\\ngreat expense to himself, and then has cured many\\nhundreds of people of their diseases for nothing, not\\na single secular paper has given him one\\' kind word.\\nIf they did not choose to investigate cases of cure,\\ninstead of picking out cases of failure, they might at\\nleast have said that although he was a fanatic, he had\\na benevolent look, and went through the farce of\\nattempting to heal people with benevolent intentions.\\nDr. Newton, in the early days of Spiritualism, was so\\ninured to newspaper untruth in America, that it has\\nlittle effect upon him, but during the worst days of\\nSpiritualism in America the press was not so thoroughly\\nunscrupulous towards him as the London newspapers\\nhave been during the past four weeks. Had he brought\\nover from the United States a woolly-haired rhinosce-\\nros, or a troupe of performing monkeys, the London\\nnewspapers would have been loud in his praise, and\\nwould have described the keeper as a benevolent-\\nlooking individual. But as Dr. Newton simply comes\\nto heal as many as he can of the sick and afflicted,\\nfree of charge, he is subjected to newspaper misrepre¬\\nsentation, in lieu of the crucifixion which sometimes\\nbefel such workers in the days of old. Every pulpit in\\nthe land condemns to everlasting torments those who\\ndo not believe, on traditionary testimony, that healing\\nby laying on of hands was performed more than 1800\\nyears ago, but most of the same pulpits, backed by the\\nnewspapers, will condemn as lunatics and impostors\\nthose who believe and know, from personal observa¬\\ntion and personal investigation, that such things take\\nplace to-day.\\nAs regards his treatment by the crowds who have\\nsurrounded him at his work. Dr. Newton has not met\\nwith more opposition here than was the case in the\\nearly days of Spiritualism in some of the cities of\\nAmerica. Last Saturday, however, some roughs\\nattempted to mob him at the Depository, and there was\\nsome disturbance. Usually in such cases, there is a\\nstrong division of opinion among the people, and those\\nwho have experienced or witnessed cures, expostulate\\nwith those who want to interfere; so that between the\\ntwo parties. Dr. Newton can go On with his work in\\ntolerable peace. These discussions often last long after\\nhe has left the building, and one Sunday night, a full\\nhour after he and the auditory had left the Cavendish\\nBooms, a gentleman found a knot of men still discussing\\nthe matter out in the street, and two of them pre¬\\npreparing to fight over it, when he interfered. While\\nDr. Newton has worked at the Depository, he has been\\nvery much aided by Mr. N. E. Daw, who attended\\nwith him very regularly, and by his gentlemanly\\nbearing and good temper, did much to preserve\\nharmony and order, as ;well as to tone down\\nthose persons disposed to be unruly. This aid from a\\ntrue friend made Dr. Newton’s work very much easier\\nthan it otherwise would have been.\\nIn the list of persons relieved, published in this\\narticle, there is the possibility of a patient having\\nunder-stated or over-stated his case; or there may\\npossibly be a hoax or two among the number, though it\\nis unlikely, as most of the persons appeared to be very\\nseriously impressed. A single case of this kind proves\\nnothing; but it is quite plain that anybody by taking\\na cab, and calling upon say two dozen of the sufferers\\nmentioned in the list, can get for himself unanswerable\\nproof of the truth or falsehood of Dr. Newton’s pre¬\\ntensions. If a cabman has been blind of one eye for\\nyears before consulting Dr. Newton, and afterwards\\ncould see, the fact must be patent to all his friends and\\nneighbours, beyond the \\' possibility of collusion or\\ndeception.\\nUpon reviewing all that has here been placed on\\nrecord, the question very naturally arises whether the\\ncures performed by Dr. Newton are due to the action\\nof the mind of the patient upon the ailments of the\\nphysical body, such mental action being aroused by\\nconfidence in the powers possessed by the operator.\\nThis explanation does not apply to case 63, where a\\nbaby was cured of curvature of the spine, for mani¬\\nfestly the imagination of an infant a year old did not\\ncome into play. About a fortnight ago, Mr. Thomas\\nEveritt, of 26, Penton-street, Pentonville, went with\\nDr. Newton in a cab to see a patient at Dais ton. On\\n76\\nTHE SPIRITUALIST.\\nJune 15, 1870.\\nthe way the cab horse was seized with the “ blind\\nstaggers,” and pulled up; a knot of five or six men\\ngathered round, and the cabman prepared to bleed the\\nhorse, which he said was subject to such fits. Dr.\\nNewton told the man not to touch the horse, then he\\nmade a few mesmeric passes over its head, the swollen\\nveins of the head subsided, and in a few minutes the\\nhorse was well enough to proceed, much to the astonish¬\\nment of the cabman, who was profuse in his thanks.\\nIn this case the cure can scarcely be attributed to\\nmental impressions aroused in the brain of the patient.\\nThen comes the question whether mesmerism will\\naccount for the cures effected, and undoubtedly this\\nexplanation would by itself cover a great number of the\\ncases already recorded. The orthodox members of the\\nmedical profession have, to a large extent, been forced\\nof late years to recognise mesmerism, which is included\\nin many of their books under the name of “ artificial\\nsomnambulism.” Mesmeric periodicals, such as the\\nZoist, contain very many perfectly authenticated cases\\nof cures by mesmerism. The Biological Review, of\\nOctober, 1858, conducted by Mr. K. E. H. Mackenzie,\\nP.S.A., F.A.S.L., contains a list of cures effected by\\nMr. Capern, a remarkably powerful mesmerist, at the\\nMesmeric Infirmary, between the 14th September,\\n1855, and 13th March, 1856, as follows :—\\nTwo females of pains in teeth, and face  in 3 minutes\\nOne female and one man of ditto   „ 6 „\\nTwo men and one female of ditto   „ 7 „\\nOne man of rheumatism ... ™   ... „ 7 „\\nTwo men of ditto      „ 8 „\\nOne man of relaxed sore throat   „ 8 „\\nTwo men of rheumatism  „ 10- „\\nOne man of chalky gout in finger  „ 10 „\\nTwo mens of pains from wounds   „ 10 „\\nOne man of injury from a fall  10 „\\nOne man.of a sprained hack ... .1. ...    „ 14 „\\nOne woman of injury  „ 15\\nOne man of pains in gums and teeth   „ 15 „\\nOne man of rheumatism   „ 20 „\\nOne man of Crimean ague  „ 30 „\\nThe difference, then, between Dr. Newton and this\\nvery powerful mesmeric operator, is that Dr. Newton\\nperforms much more remarkable cures, and more of\\nthem, in [one morning than were effected by a good\\noperator at the Mesmeric Infirmary in six months.\\nMoreover, Dr. Newton, on an average, only gives two\\nor three minutes to each patient. Hence, with the\\nknowledge of the fact that Dr. Newton is a medium,\\nand that spirits have the power more or less of acting\\nupon the bodies and minds of human beings, the most\\nsimple explanation of Dr. Newton’s success is, that he\\nis a powerful mediumistic mesmerist, assisted in his\\nwork by disembodied spirits.\\nTery often Dr. Newton lays his hands on a patient,\\nand [says at once “ I cannot cure this person. Some¬\\ntimes he gives a reason, such as—ff One leg is shorter\\nthan the other, and I cannot lengthen it; ” or, “ The\\ndrums of the ear are gone in this case, and I cannot\\ngive new ones.” Deaf and dumb cases he refused to\\nattempt to cure; but not cases of partial deafness, or\\npartial dumbness. Paralysis he often fails with, but he\\ndoes not refuse to make the attempt, knowing that a\\nfew successful cases will be mingled with the failures.\\nWhen any part of the body has been cut with a surgical\\ninstrument, or knife, he usually is unable to effect a\\ncure. Dr. Newton, also, does not cure quite so many\\npeople as he himself believes that he does; for many\\npass too quickly under his hands for him to know\\naccurately the circumstances of the case, or the exact\\nmeasure of relief given.\\nDr. Newton has had\\'mediumistic powers from a child,\\nand when a boy at school, he would often spend his\\nSaturday holidays in the fields talking to spirits, who\\nhe knew could hear him, though he at that time, could\\nnot see them, nor has he any but occasional seeing\\npowers at present. When young he was an im-\\npressional medium, and often intuitively knew many\\nof the coming events of his life, though at first he\\nplaced little reliance of those impressional glimpses of\\nthe future. He states that fourteen years ago, before\\nhe began to heal the afflicted in public at all, he was\\nspiritually impressed to know that in the future he\\nwould be healing the sick in Liverpool and London, as\\nat present. At times Dr. Newton has clairaudient\\npowers, and can hear the spirits speaking to him.\\nWhile talking to Dr. Newton about the develop¬\\nment of his powers, he said under spirit in¬\\nfluence—“ I am a man of sorrows and acquainted\\nwith grief. This is how this healing power was\\ndeveloped, and so requisite is sorrow for develop¬\\nment in righteousness and truth, that I thank\\nGod for every grief and trial I have had. I\\nknow that I have to wear the crown of thorns\\nthrough life, to bear the cross, and to be persecuted,.\\nfor these are the pre-requisites of the power of heal¬\\ning. These alone can give the power, and they are\\npositively as necesary as light is necessary to enable\\nman to see with the natural eyes. So, when I am\\npersecuted, I feel that I am living a life of practical\\nChristianity, for ‘blessed are ye when men shall re¬\\nvile you and persecute you, and say all manner of\\nevil against you falsely.’ ”\\nTo sum up all that has gone before, Dr. Newton\\npossesses the power of performing many wonderful\\ncures, intermixed with many unsuccessful cases. His\\nmediumship varies in power a little, but not much, at\\ndifferent times, for it acted less effectually when he was\\nfatigued by his journey to Nottingham. His clairvoyant\\npowers are not often excited, and when they are so, the\\nresults \\'are sometimes reliable and sometimes the re¬\\nverse. He is a kind-hearted good man, with a cheerful\\nand attractive face, having nothing of the visionary in\\nit, as anybody may see by his photographic portrait.\\nHis ways and thoughts are not the ways and thoughts\\nof conventional people; he has all the simplicity and\\ntrust of a little child, and trusts himself implicitly in\\nthe hands of his spirit guides. If they told him to\\nsalute a brother upon a public platform with a holy\\nkiss, he would do it, although the performance of such\\na Scriptural and spiritual injunction, would of course\\nform a fine source of fun and ridicule to those who\\ndesire to raise prejudices against him and his friends.\\nDr. Newton is seen to most advantage while in the\\nperformance of his healing work, for he has kind words\\nand healing powers to benefit all who come under his\\nhands; he treats rich and poor alike, and to see Dr.\\nNewton standing with his hands upon the shoulders of\\nsome poor sick boy or girl, all rags, and tatters, and dirt\\nfrom head to foot—to hear him pouring loving words\\ninto their ears, and healing their diseases with his\\nhands—is living evidence to the observer of the powers\\nof practical Christianity. Dr. Newton is engaged in\\nsomewhat dangerous work, for to heal the sick by the\\nlaying on of hands, is an offence in the eyes of society,\\nwhich must be put down by newspaper abuse and mis¬\\nrepresentation, or by mobbing. Hence, whatever his\\nfuture course may be in England, his hands should be\\nstrengthened in every possible way by all friends of the\\nSpiritual movement.\\nReports of JBmmgs.\\nFAREWELL MEETING TO ME. PEEBLES.\\nOx Thursday evening, June 2nd, a meeting convened to bid\\nfarewell to Mr. J. M. Peebles, American Consul at Trebizond,\\nbefore his departure to the United States, was held in the\\nCavendish Rooms, Mortimer-street, Regent-street. Mr. Peebles\\nduring his few months stay in England, had worked so hard\\non behalf of the cause of Spiritualism, and had made so many\\nfriends by his kindly disposition, that the hall was crowded to\\nexcess in every part. Mr. H. D. Jencken, M.R.I., F.R.G.S.,\\nbarrister-at-law, presided.\\nThe President, in his opening remarks, stated the purpose\\nfor which [the meeting had been called, and spoke highly of\\nthe capacity for work and the disinterestedness of Mr. Peebles;\\nhe told how Mr. Peebles had organised the Sunday evening\\nmeetings in the Cavendish Rooms, and that not upon a\\nsectarian narrow type, but upon principles which would admit\\nall kinds of Spiritualists. He had also aided similar institu¬\\ntions in other towns, and had been endeavouring to found\\nchildren’s lyceums for the education of children—in fact, he\\nnow has a book on that subject in the press. The merits of\\nMr. Peebles had been recognised in Paris, and he had been\\nmade an honorary fellow of the Socidtd Parisienne des Etudes\\nSpirites, as would be seen by the following letter :—\\nSoci6t6 Parisienne des Etudes Spirites Fondfie k Paris, le ler Avril, 1858,\\npar Allan Kardee, Rue Molifere, 27.\\nParis, le 28 Mai, 1870.\\nMonsieur et cher confrere.—La Socidtd Parisienne des Etudes\\nSpirites me charge de vous remercier de I’offre que vous lui avez faite de\\n1’un de vos excellents ouvrage (The Seers of the Ages) dont un de ses\\nmembres doit lui rendre compte dans une de ses proohaines stances.\\nElle vous sait dgalement un grd inflni de 1’intention ou vous paraissez etre,\\nde faire connaitre les livres d’Allan Hardee en Amdrique et de travailler\\nainsi h I’unification des croyances, qui ne sera possible qu’k mesure que\\nI’explication de la doctrine supdrieure de la reincarnation viendra s’allier les\\nhommes sur le terrain d’une thdorie rationelle de la vie et du progrfes.\\n11 nous semble trfes important que, sans tenir compte des nationality tous\\nceux qui rapprochent une foi commune soient toujours en communion de\\ncoeur et d’intelligence et que le Spiritism prenne un caractfere international.\\nAussi notre socMte serait-elle tres fibre de pouvoir vous compter parmi\\nles siennes, et de vous voir accepter le titre de membre correspondant\\nhonoraire qu’elle est heureuse de vous offirir.\\nAgrdez, Monsieur et cher confrfere I’assurance des mes sentiments les plus\\ndistingubs. E. Bonnemere, President de la Society\\nParisienne des Etudes Spirites, Membre de la Socidtd\\ndes gens de lettres et de la Socidtd des auteurs dra-\\nmatiques. 31, Rue de Boulogne, a Paris.\\nMonsieur Peebles.*\\nOf late years Spiritualism has been spreading very rapidly\\nin England, and he was indebted to Mr. Harrison, who sat by\\nhis side, for the idea that at first Spiritualism, like a stone\\nthrown into water, made only a small ring, but gradually\\nthrew out larger and larger circles, till at the present time it\\ncovers a very extensive area, and before long it will begin to\\nclash with vested interests ; when that is the case, there will\\nbe considerable agitation and disturbance. Recently, when in\\nParis, he had met M. Leon Favre, Consul-General of France,\\na highly intelligent Spiritualist, who told him that in that\\nnation some very warm work in connection with the move¬\\nment would begin before long, for already it is in opposition\\nto some of the vested interests which have ruled the country\\nfor the last thousand years.\\nMr. Jencken then read the following resolution, which\\nhad been placed in his hands by Mr. T. Shorter :—\\n“ That this meeting heartily expresses its warm appreciation of Ihe dis¬\\ntinguished services \"of Mr. J. M. Peebles as a lecturer, author, and eloquent\\nexpounder of the important truths and high moral teachings of Spiritua¬\\nlism.”\\n* Translation.\\nThe Paris Socibtb for Spiritual Studies. Pounded at Paris on the 1st of\\nApril, 1858, by Allan Kardec, 27, Rue Moliere.\\nParis, May 28th, 1870.\\nSir and Dear Brother,—The Paris Society for Spiritual Studies desires\\nme to thank you for the present which you have made them of one of your\\nexcellent works, “ The Seers of the Ages.” One of their members will\\nreport on it at a forthcoming stance of the society.\\nThey moreover are gratefnl to you for the intention which you appear to\\nhave of making the books of Allan kardec known in America. You are\\nthus working towards a unity of belief which can only he accomplished to\\nthe extent that the lofty doctrine of re-incarnation is made clear, on\\nthe basis of a rational theory concerning life and progress.\\nIt seems to us a matter of great importance that, without regard to\\ndifferences of nationality, all those who share in a common belief should\\nbe\\' in constant communion of heart and intellect, and that Spiritualism\\nshould take an international character.\\nOur Society would be proud to count you among those belonging to\\nthem. They beg you to accept the title of honorary and corresponding\\nmember, which they are pleased te offer you.—Accept our, &c.,\\nE. Bonnehere, President of the Paris Society\\nfor Spiritual studies, member of the Literary Society, and of\\nthe Society of Dramatic Authors. 31, Rue de Boulogne,\\nParis.\\nMr. Peebles.\\nMr. Thomas Shorter said—I have great pleasure in being\\nwith you this evening, to express in the terms of the resolution\\nmy warm appreciation of the distinguished services of Mr. J.\\nM. Peebles as a lecturer, author, and eloquent expounder of\\nthe important truths and high moral teaching of Spiritualism ;\\nand in that expression I am sure you will all most cordially\\nconcur. I feel the more satisfaction at being present on this\\noccasion as I was unavoidably absent at the reception given\\nto Mr. Peebles on his arrival in this country. I have, however,\\nan advantage now which I could not have had then. I,\\nindeed, knew him as an elegant scholarly writer—an earnest\\nand able worker, always spoken of to me by mutual friends in\\nterms of the highest commendation ; but I had not then the\\nprivilege of personally knowing him, and of witnessing in\\nsocial intercourse those frank and genial qualities, that\\ncheerful disposition and kindly nature, which have so endeared\\nhim to all. Of the value of his public ministrations in this\\nplace, you, who have attended them during the last four\\nmonths, are fully qualified to judge. I hate not been able to\\nattend them regularly, but I have attended them sufficiently\\nto make me regret that I have not been able to avail myself\\nmore fully of those opportunities of profiting by the excellent\\ndiscourses Mr. Peebles has delivered. The predominant im¬\\npression left on my mind by those I have heard, has but con¬\\nfirmed that received from personal intercourse with him to\\nwhich I have already referred. It is not so much what he has\\nsaid, though he has said many excellent things, which we\\nshould all do well to remember, and be all the better for\\nremembering, which we should not only carry about in our\\nmemory, but carry out in our life ; but that which has most\\nimpressed me has been the true catholic spirit, the Christian\\ntemper, combining firmness in the assertion of principle with\\nsuavity and gentleness in so presenting it as to win the\\naffections no less than to convince the judgment. He has\\npresented truth in the spirit of truth—which is the spirit of\\ncharity. He has given us an example of absolute mental\\nindependence—the utmost freedom of thought and expression,\\ncombined wiih the most reverential feeling, and with all\\nrespect for those whose theological opinions may, in some im¬\\nportant respects, differ from his own. He has shown not only\\nthat these qualities are compatible, but that they blend in per¬\\nfect harmony—that the one is the natural product of the other;\\nfor an enlightened reverence—that highest reverence we owe\\nto God—naturally leads us to respect all whom He has formed\\nin the image of His own Divine nature, and who, therefore,\\nare measureably partakers of his spirit. This union of know¬\\nledge and reverence, this blended action of free intellect and\\nreligious feeling, seems to me pre-eminently the great need of\\nour present age. We have many men who know much of\\nmany things ; who can count the stars of heaven, and classify\\nthe products and inhabitants of the earth, and of the sea; who\\ncan tell you why the grass is green, and why the sky is blue ;\\nand talk learnedly of the genesis of life and its developments,\\nbut who seem touched with no sense of awe and unutterable\\nwonder at the mystery which life presents,—no feeling of\\nreverence as before an Infinite Presence, a Holy and Eternal\\nLove which, like the blue sky, bends over all;—One in whom\\nwe live and move and have our being—One with whom we\\ncan hold communion, and in whose faithfulness we can trust;\\n—a consciousness which, when deeply felt, thrills the heart,\\ncausing it to raise the grateful prayer, or hymn of praise, or\\nto muse in silent worship. On the other hand, how many per¬\\nsons there are of sincere and fervent but narrow piety, with\\nno ample stores of varied knowledge, no large and liberal cul¬\\nture, no intellectual expanse, with horizon stretching out to¬\\nwards the infinite, but who sluggishly move through life,\\npacing round and round, and never passing out of or beyond\\nthe old narrow tracks of custom and tradition. \"We want\\nneither an undevout science nor an ignorant devotion. It is\\nnot good, but most harmful to the individual and to society\\nfor either the spiritual offertories or the intellectual faculties\\nto remain thus torpid. Let us not pamper any one portion of\\nour nature, and allow another to go lean and starved. We\\nwant both mind-culture and soul-culture :—\\nLet knowledge grow from more to more.\\nBut more of reverence in us dwell,\\nThat mind and soul, according well,\\nMay make one music.\\nThat is the true music of the spheres. The music of angels—\\nmusic to the heavenly song of “ Peace on earth, good-will to\\nmen;” for these will naturally flow from a well-balanced,\\nharmoniously developed nature. That is the true “ Harmonial\\nPhilosophy,” whether it be that so-called or not; and this is\\nthe philosophy of which, if I rightly interpret him, our friend\\nis the able exponent. We have to-night on the platform our\\ngood brother Dr. Newton, who is doing so much amongst us\\nin the cure of physical disease, but there are other diseases and\\ninfirmities than those of the body, and which are more\\ndifficult of cure. To unseal the blind eyes of ignorance, to\\nunstop the deaf ears of prejudice, to restore vigour to the\\nparalyzed affections, and cause the vital currents of spiri¬\\ntual life to freely flow through all the veins and arteries of\\nthe moral nature—this, indeed, so far as we can be mediums\\nfor its accomplishment, is more truly “ miraculous ” than any\\nhealing of bodily disease, for spiritual disease is of our inner\\nnature, and has its source and spring in the very fountains of\\nour life. This is the other side of the gift of healing, its neces¬\\nsary complement and completion. This spiritual healing is\\nthe work in which our honoured guest has been, as it seems\\nto me, more especially engaged amongst us. He has sought\\nto allay irritation of feeling, to soften the asperities of con¬\\ntroversy, to exorcise the evil demons of anger and resentment,\\nto do the blessed work of the peacemaker, and to enforce the\\nimportance and urgent need of working out those essential\\ntruths in which we agree, instead of wrangling over those\\nthings concerning which we differ. There is one considera¬\\ntion which qualifies the pleasure of our present meeting.\\nThis is a Farewell Soiree : there is always a tone of sadness\\nin that word farewell—and yet it has another side—it is a\\nword very beautiful and full of meaning; with us, at least, I\\nam sure it is most appropriate and expressive ; for wherever\\n\\'our friend may be, whether personally present with us, or\\nabsent from us, our hearts’ sincere wish towards him is, and\\nwill ever be—fare you well! It is true we anticipate with\\nlively satisfaction that our friend will ere long return—we\\nhope with renovated health, to carry on the good work he has\\nso well begun—not only here in London, but in the provinces.\\nIt is, however, barely possible that all within the sound of my\\nvoice will ever on earth meet again, but it is one of the conso¬\\nlations of our philosophy and our faith that no bodily absence,\\nno mountain barrier or interposing ocean, or even change of\\nworlds, can effectually separate those who are one in sympathy\\nand in soul. The “ Communion of Saints,” affirmed by the\\nChurch, is but the theological form’of expression of a universal\\ntruth. It is to me one of the most beautiful and beneficent\\ndispensations of Providence that gradually, as we advance in\\nJune 15, 1870.\\nTHE SPIRITUALIST.\\n77\\nlife, the balance of attraction changes, drawing ns with\\nsteadily increasing force from the natural to the spiritual\\nworld. In the early hours of our brief day of mortal life we\\nare surrounded by kindred and playmates, and friends and\\nlovers, all is hope and promise, flowers spring up in our path,\\nthe lark carols joyfully his matin-song, and no cloud dims\\nour bright blue sky ; but as the sun passes its meridian and\\nthe shadows lengthen before ns, and the cool hours of even¬\\ntide draw on, friend after friend departs, the father’s protect¬\\ning arm is no longer around us, we feel not the mother’s\\nnightly kiss upon our cheek, nor hear the ringing laughter and\\nthe merry voices of our early home ; the balance has turned,\\nand now dips ever more heavily to the other side ;—as this\\nworld recedes from us, the other looms larger and draws\\nnearer, and as our pilgrim feet near the broad and\\nshining river that rolls between, loved voices call to us, and\\nthe angel-forms of the departed stretch forth eager arms to\\nwelcome us, and we are ready to exclaim with Simeon of old,\\n“ Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace !” We\\nneed not, however, wait for the Death-angel to usher us into\\nthe heavenly kingdom; we may, if we will, enter into heaven\\nhere, and now; or, rather, we may let it enter into us; for, as\\na great philosopher has said, “ Certainly it is Heaven npon\\nEarth for a man’s mind to move in Charity, trust in Provi¬\\ndence, and rest upon the poles of Truth.”\\nMr. W. Tebb then seconded the resolution, and reviewed\\nthe work performed by Mr. Peebles during his stay in London.\\nHe said that Mr. Peebles had given his hearers most hopeful\\nviews about the other life, although he had said little about such\\ndogmas of worship as total depravity, original sin,\\' and endless\\nmisery, and instead of such subjects had said a great deal about\\nthose Divine enunciations contained in the “ Sermon on the\\nMonnt.” Mr. Peebles also had said very little about the sins of\\nthe Jews, and a great deal about the shortcomings of Spiri¬\\ntualists, which plan he thought quite as calculated to do good\\nas those teachings which the English public are accustomed\\nto hear. (Hear, hear.) At the present time there are certain\\npolitical difficulties between this country and America, and\\nif there is one nation to which we are bound by closer ties\\nthan to another, it is America; he, however, had no doubt\\nthat the differences would be amicably settled.\\nThe Chairman then put the resolution to the meeting, and\\nit was carried amid loud applause. He afterwards read the\\nsecond resolution, placed in his hands by the Eev. Jabez\\nBums, D.D., of Paddington\\n“That Mr. Peebles be cordially invited to return to this country again as\\nsoon as convenient to him, to further the good work of spiritual enlighten¬\\nment and organisation in London and the provinces, which he has so de¬\\nvotedly and successfully inaugurated during the last four and a half\\nmonths.”\\nDr. Burns said that he was exceedingly pleased with both\\nthe resolutions which had been read by the chairman, and\\nthat he had listened with very much pleasure to the address\\nwhich had been delivered by Mr. Shorter, for it met his own\\nviews as to the right method of promulgating truth of any\\nand every kind. He had not heard much that Mr. Peebles\\nhad said, but with such of his teachings as he had read, he\\nwas delighted. Whatever was true in Spiritualism would\\nabide, and whatever was not true in the movement, those who\\nwere listening to him, did not wish to abide—(Hear, hear,\\nand overwhelming applause)—therefore he (Dr. Burns) was\\nof the same opinion as themselves. All being thus desirous\\nto gain truth, it must be remembered that truth is never\\ngained except at a sacrifice, and in buying the knowlege of\\ntrath, many cherished and pre-conceived views must be sur¬\\nrendered. As for the theologies of the day, he wished that\\nevery form of theology might perish, that had not truth in it;\\njust in proportion to the amount of truth which they contain\\nshould those theologies live : when they are not true, let them\\ndie, and the sooner they die the better. (Applause.) Those\\nwho have truth should be manly enough to profess what they\\nbelieve, and not to be ashamed of it, though this course of\\naction sometimes requires great courage to follow. He was very\\nmuch pleased with what had been said in Mr. Shorter’s address\\nabout charity and love ; for these virtues should be used even in\\nthe promulgation of truth. Mr. Peebles had once done him the\\nhonour to come to a meeting over which he (Dr. Burns)\\npresided; and directly he saw Mr. Peebles, he fell in love with\\nhim at first sight, for many years ago he had learnt some\\nphrenological truth, so that when he looked at Mr. Peebles,\\nhe could not help admiring his noble head, with so much\\nbenevolence and affection written thereon. At the present\\nmeeting he had marked with delight the gentleness of coun¬\\ntenance which Mr. Peebles displayed to everybody : he loved\\nhim because of his lovable spirit; he felt that there was com¬\\nmunion of mind between them, and should for one, be rejoiced\\nto hear when Mr. Peebles come back from America. He (Dr.\\nBums) had once been to America, and at Boston, before\\nleaving, they gave him a farewell soiree, so he could\\nsympathise with Mr. Peebles in his situation that evening.\\nHe hoped before long to visit America again, and to go round\\nthe world by way of China, Japan, New Zealand, and Aus¬\\ntralia, a journey which can now be made in not much more\\ntime than it took George Whitfield to go from London to the\\nUnited States. He prayed for uninterrupted peace between\\nAmerica and Great Britain. He would rather have the\\nhealing power to remove sadness and sorrow from human\\nbeings, than be the monarch of the universe ; and he trusted\\nthat God would bless Dr. Newton and his friend Mr. Peebles.\\nHe thanked those listening to him for their patience, and\\nmoved the adoption of the resolution.\\nMr. J. Burns seconded the resolution, and spoke of the de¬\\nvotion and labour of the ladies in getting up the meeting,\\nwhich was entirely their work. He did not repine at Mr.\\nPeebles’ leaving them, but was rather thankful that he ever\\ncame ; to grieve would be selfishness—ingratitude ; his heart\\nwas full of joy and gladness at the wealth of affection which\\nhe felt for the guest of the evening. Mr. Peebles had done a\\ngreat work, not only in England, in London, but throughout\\nEurope and the East; he was a living embodiment of the\\ncosmopolitan genius of Spiritualism which owned all men as\\nbrothers, and the wide universe of God as the home of the\\nhuman soul. Every man gave off an influence as he moved\\nabout in the world, and if it were one of love and goodness,\\nthen to travel amongst various nations would unite them all\\nin one bond or net of sympathy. He hoped to see Mr. Peebles\\nin London again soon. His return had been predicted by\\nspirit agency. Mr. Peebles was in every respect a Spiritualist;\\nhe called his teaching by no other names, and kept it pure\\nfrom all creeds. He was almost constantly under spirit in¬\\nfluence and direction, as regards his writings and speaking on\\nthis subject. Even in matters of health and daily life, he was\\nthe special care of dear friends in the spirit world, who,\\nthrough him had a work to do for humanity; he felt, there¬\\nfore, that it would be well with their friend wherever he was.\\nGod and good angels were with him.\\nMrs. C. F. VARLEYthen stepped upon the platform, and pre¬\\nsented Mr. Peebles with a handsome purse, upon a crimson\\ncushion, saying:—“ I am desired by the ladies of the committee\\nto present you with this purse as a mark of gratitude.” The\\npurse contained rather more than £25, the proceeds derived\\nfrom the sale of tickets of admission to the meeting. The\\nChairman repeated Mrs. Yarley’s words to the audience. As\\nthis Was totally unexpected by Mr. Peebles, he was for the\\nmoment evidently overcome, and unable to collect his thoughts.\\nSome friends present also presented him with an album, con¬\\ntaining good portraits of many of the chief celebrities in\\nEurope.\\nMr. J. M. Peebles then said—Mr. President, Ladies and\\nGentlemen,—It seldom falls to the lot of a mortal to experi¬\\nence a moment so full of real enjoyment as this—when rising\\nto return thanks for the honour you have done me upon this\\noccasion—an occasion to me of both joy and sadness. It is\\nnot so much myself you intend to honour as the heavenly\\nprinciples of the spiritual philosophy of which I am but a\\nhumble advocate. Your terms of commendation I fear are\\nabove my deserts, however sincerely and conscientiously I\\nmay have advocated the truth, and discharged my duty as a\\npublic teacher. Still, fully appreciating them, I shall most\\ngratefully treasure your kind works and expressions of good¬\\nwill in the silent memory chambers of my soul’s sanctuary—\\ntreasure them as the generous overflow of hearts that beat in\\nunison with mine, and whose aspirations are to promote the\\nbest mental and spiritual interests of a common humanity. It\\nis not my purpose to make a speech ; infinitely do I prefer\\nlistening to others. Looking around, it quite overjoys me to\\nsee so many familiar faces, so many noble-minded English¬\\nmen, some of whom have already made their mark upon this\\nillustrious age in science and literature—so many kind-\\nhearted and earnest believers in the ministry of angels—those\\nangels of God who delight in returning to earth to demon¬\\nstrate immortality, and to aid their mortal brothers and\\nsisters in their weary journeyings towards the shores of the\\nbetter land. The- sympathy and friendship of such a con¬\\ngregation as I see before me this evening constitute the\\nproudest laurels a man can win. Be assured I shall wear them\\nin my heart of hearts till I meet you in the upper kingdoms of\\neternity ; where affection is power, where love is life, and life\\na perpetual growth in the good, the beautiful, and the true.\\nThe address of the chairman, so clear and cogent, of Mr.\\nShorter, sound and well-timed, of Mr. Tebb, breathing the\\nspirit of sincerity and goo’d-will, of the Eev. Dr. Bums, rich,\\nracy, eloquent and full of charity, of Mr. James Bums,\\nearnest and truly heartfelt—these, coupled with the excellent\\nremarks of others bountiful in expressions of a general soul-\\nsympathy, all tend to bind your better natures to mine with\\nthat threefold strand not easily broken. The presentations are\\nmost acceptable. I shall endeavour to prove myself worthy, not\\nonly of your friendship, but of the valuable gifts which you have\\nbeen so kind as to tender me. The address of the Eev. Dr.\\nBums, when speaking of Whitfield, reminds me of this anec¬\\ndote. Whitfield, when speaking once, in one of the States of\\nAmerica, suddenly stopped and turned his eyes ^heavenward,\\nexclaimed, ‘ ‘ Father Abram, are there any Baptists in heaven ? ”\\n“ No ! ” was the response. ‘ ‘ Are any Methodists in Heaven ?• ”\\n“No!” Any Presbyterians?” “No!” Any Churchmen? ”\\n“No!” “Any Unitarians?” “No!” “Who are in\\nHeaven then ? ” Father Abraham replied, “ They are all\\nChristians, that is, good men. They have left their sectarian\\nnames and dogmatic theologies all behind them.” It is not\\nfaith, not metaphysical belief, but works and good deeds that\\nentitle to happiness. Beautiful is this spirit of charity\\nwhich crops out from progressive souls in all lands and climes.\\nI cannot let this occasion pass without thanking the ladies for\\ntheir efficiency in conceiving and executing the arrangements\\nupon this occasion. It has been truthfully said that woman\\nis first in every good word and work—it is certain that she\\nwas last at the cross and first at the grave of the risen\\nSaviour. Woman’s influence has swayed sceptres, dethroned\\nrulers, and ever exercises an uplifting, a healing, and holy\\ninfluence. Though oceans roll between us, though mountains\\nlift their hoary heads to separrte us, I shall never forget\\nthe warmth of English hearts, nor the social enjoyments of\\nEnglish homes, and though I shonld never meet you again\\nface to face upon the shores of mortality, it is to me a beau¬\\ntiful thought that I shall meet you, know you, aud love\\nyou in that world of immortality where farewells are never\\nheard, and where friendships and soul unions are eternal.\\nThe President next called upon Dr. Newton to address the\\nmeeting, and added that he had called casually upon Dr.\\nNewton at his hotel, without telling him that he was suffering\\nfrom astigmatism; in fact, in consequence of terrible injuries\\nwhich he had received in Spain, he saw all things double with\\nhis left eye, and the field of view had a brownish tint. Dr.\\nNewton mesmerised the eye at once, removed the evil of\\ndouble vision, and so far restored the eye that he can now\\nread the smallest print with it, which h\\'e could not do before.\\nDr. Newton said that in Mr. Peebles his hearers had re¬\\nceived not only a righteous man, but a prophet, who had given\\nthem evidence that the same power exists now which existed\\nyears ago. Among the spirits aiding him in his (Dr. Newton’s)\\nwork of healing the sick, was Jesus himself. “ These signs\\nshall follow them that believe—they shall lay their hands\\nupon the sick and they shall recover.” Are these signs in the\\nchurches ? Do they follow the churches ? He (Dr. Newton)\\nhad been sent to this country more for spiritual healing, than\\nfor healing the pains of the body, and this power of healing\\nwould do a great work in England. The dough has already\\nbeen raised, soon the bread will be put into the oven, and be\\nbrought forth for the benefit of’ those hungry souls who have\\nbeen fed on husks, and who dread an angry God, and a burn¬\\ning hell. It is a happy knowledge that the brightest spirits\\nthat ever walked the earth are with us by day and by night,\\nand that their love becomes more intensified because they are\\nin spirit life. He then announced that for some weeks to\\ncome he would attend at “ The Depository,” Gray’s-inn-road,\\nevery morning from ten to twelve o’clock, to heal the sick\\nwithout charge of any kind. He closed with a few words of\\nkindness to Mr. Peebles.\\nMr. Shorter proposed and Mr. Burns seconded a vote of\\nthanks to the ladies, and those who had aided in various ways\\nthe purposes of the meeting. Lastly, Mr. Harrison proposed\\nand Mr. F. N. Daw seconded, a vote of thanks to Mr. Jencken,\\nthe president.\\nSome of the intervals between the speeches here recorded\\nwere filled up music, songs, and recitations. Mrs. Yarley sang\\nGounod’s “ Serenade ” with much good taste; also “ The\\nGuardian Angel ” ( Gounod,\\'); the rendering of this latter song\\nwas much admired, and the words were very clearly heard\\nthroughout the hall.

The\\nrescued men say that when embarking they were called on by\\nsome unseen person to return. Not heeding the warning they\\nrowed on, when they heard a horn sounded, to. which also they\\npaid no attention. A few moments before the boat upset they\\nsay they heard laughter and other sounds quite close to them,\\nbut the darkness rendered every object invisible. There is\\nwe believe no doubt of the good faith in which these state\\nments are made, or that the men themselves are fully con¬\\nvinced that they heard the noises they describe.”\\nThe Royal Institution.—On Friday, June 3rd, Pro¬\\nfessor Max Muller, M.A., delivered an amjising and very in¬\\nteresting lecture, at the Eoyal Institution, on\\' “ The Migration\\nof Fables.” The proverb, “ Do not count your chickens before\\nthey are hatched,” is derived from a fable which the lecturer\\ntraced back through many of the chief nations and languages\\nof Europe and Asia, to the literature of India 300 years before\\nChrist. The migration of fables has usually been from east to\\nwest, across Europe, and seldom in the reverse direction. He\\nalso pointed out how Buddha at last was made a saint in the\\nEomish Church nnder the name of Saint Josephat. This an¬\\nnouncement caused a burst of laughter, which the lecturer\\nstopped by remarking that if Buddha lived as he is said to\\nhave done, no man ever better deserved to be made into a\\nsaint by his fellow-creatures. On Thursday, May 19th, Pro¬\\nfessor Tyndall, in a lecture upon “ Electricity,” described many\\nof the inventions of Mr. C. F. Varley, C.E., and exhibited the\\napparatus at work; Mrs. Yarley, Lord Lindsay, and many\\nother Spiritualists, were among the listeners. At the close\\nof the lecture Professor Tyndall invited Mr. Yarley to\\naddress the meeting, and he did so, after being received\\nwith considerable applause. The following notice of\\nthe lecture is from the Daily Telegraph of May the 20th :—\\n“ Yesterday afternoon, at the lecture by Professor Tyndall, at\\nthe Eoyal Institution, Mr. C. F. Yarley’s artificial telegraphic\\nline between London and Australia was exhibited. The\\nelectrical resistances of the copper conductor between the\\ndifferent stations were imitated by U-shaped tubes, filled\\nwith a solution of sulphate of zinc, through which the galvanic\\ncurrent was made to pass. The mirrors in the galvano¬\\nmeters, placed at the several stations, such as Gibraltar, Malta,\\nAlexandria, Aden, Bombay, and Melbourne, were made to\\nreflect spots of light upon the screen, so that the whole\\naudience could see the arrival .of the signals at the different\\nstations, by the motion of the spots. This represented what\\nwould really occur in a stretch of cable 14,000 miles long, and\\nthe apparatus was the same which was used in the calculation\\nof the dimensions of the first Atlantic cable. By means of\\nMr. Yarley’s 1,000 cell Daniells battery, in connection with\\n50 condensers, Professor Tyndall performed some brilliant ex¬\\nperiments ; metallic wires were heated, went to pieces, and\\nevaporated. By means of some of the apparatus, galvanic was\\nchanged into frictional electricity, and made to give long\\nsparks outside a Leyden jar. The shocks from this apparatus\\nwould have been fatal to any human being,”\\n78\\nTHE SPIRITUALIST.\\nJune 15, 1870,\\nTHE WORLD.\\nThe following is part of an inspirational poem given througli tlie medium-\\nship of Mr. T.

What are they doing ? They are scattered to the winds—have\\nno cohesion, because the ‘wildest, theory’ men leap on to the platform and\\nbear sway. Men of knowledge, of sense, retire, and refuse to co-operate.\\nIt may be said, that American serial literature consists of only one weekly\\njournal, which has a weakly existence, because it has been and is a cesspool\\nof theories, - ■ “John Jones.\\n“Enmore-park, South Norwood.\\n“May 2nd, 1870.”\\nThough having no aspirations in the line of newspaper con¬\\ntroversies, I confess to the pleasure, only excelled by the\\nmoral duty, of enlightening inquirers and correcting all mis¬\\nstatements concerning the Spiritualists of my own, this, or\\nany other country. Certainly America “ contains several\\nmillions of Spiritualists ’—that is, believers in a present\\nintercourse and communion between the inhabitants of this\\nand the world of. spirits. _ .\\n“ What are they doing ?” Well, while exercising quite as\\nmuch charity and “ cohesion ” as English Spiritualists—while\\nrefusing to support orthodox churches with their cramping\\ncreeds and dogmas, and while refraining from sending their\\nchildren to Sectarian Sunday-schools, to be taught among\\nother Christian doctrines, \\'total depravity, and a vicarious\\natonement, a future general judgment and endless hell tor¬\\nments ; they are erecting free-church edifices, leasing elegant\\nand commodious halls for seances and Sunday services,\\norganising children\\'s progressive lyceums for physical, mental,\\nand moral instruction, and deeply interesting themselves,\\ngenerally, in the reform movements of the age.\\nThat men of “knowledge and sense” refuse to co-operate\\nwith Spiritualists in America is squarely untrue^ unless Judge\\nEdmunds, Eobert Dale Owen, \\' and William L. Garrison—\\nunless General Banks, Senators Wade, Howard, Harris, and\\nmany others justly distinguished, either as judges, jurists,\\ncongressmen, poets, or authors, are utterly devoid of “ know¬\\nledge and sense.” During the delivery of our last lecture but\\none in New York, Judge Edmunds sat near us in the congre¬\\ngation, a quiet listener; and at the May anniversaries last\\nseason in Boston, Eobert Dale Owen and Judge Ladd not only\\noccupied the platform with us and other speakers, but Mr.\\nOwen delivered a very sound and logical address.\\nInstead of “ American serial literature, consisting of only\\none weekly journal, which has a weakly existence,” f as\\nalleged, it consists of The Banner of Light, American Spiri¬\\ntualist, The Beligio-Philosophical Journal, The Universe, The\\nPresent Age, and several others devoted in part to the advo¬\\ncacy of the phenomena and philosophy of Spiritualism.

Peebles.\\nJune 1st, 1870.\\nTHE BIBLE.—THE UNSEEN.—A CREED.\\nSir,—In lieu of the silly attacks on the Bible and Chris¬\\ntianity by some of your correspondents calling themselves\\n“ Spiritualists,” I suggested last month that men of matured\\nknowledge should send a series of articles on the unseen\\nelements which make the physical of man, and which pro¬\\nduce the wonderful phases of power manifested by him. By\\nso doing practical knowledge would be givdh to your readers.\\nThe Spiritualist would be the medium for thought, instead\\nof slap-dash wordage, which, besides showing gross ignorance\\nin the writers, is doing serious mischief to our common cause,\\nby leading men who know better to avoid our company.\\nIn passing, I say on my own behalf, and of others called\\nwhen needed “ leading Spiritualists,” we declare our convic¬\\ntion to be | That the Bible is the Text Book of Spiritualists:\\nthe New Testament ethics the ideal or spiritual for us and\\nour families to copy, its teachings having supernatural authority\\nhaving been heralded to man by signs and wonders.”\\nSo far as I am personally, concerned, I have only leisure to\\nsuggest an energetic movement in the direction of the natural\\nof man. I pursued the natural in years gone by, and the\\nexperience and knowledge then acquired, have been of im¬\\nmense service tome during the past fifteen years, in investiga¬\\ntions connected with the supernatural branches, and have\\nguarded me from calling many natural results, super¬\\nnatural.\\nOther men have doubtless also so studied the natural in\\nrelation to the super-natural, and they can and will forward\\nthe desired communications. I suggest that they commence\\nby giving a list of the chemical substances physical man is\\ncomposed of, and the relative quantity of each. The colour\\neach chemical produces on combustion, and the colour in\\nmass. The medicinal qualities of those substances, and their\\nforce in their natural condition, and their force when com¬\\nbined or charged with the life-power of man as a spirit, and\\nthrown by him with energy on a man full of inertness.\\nIf this method were adopted, your readers would soon solve\\nthe problem of the so-called “ teachings of Spirits ” at circles,\\nthrough mediums who are mere rush-lights, compared to the\\nmiracle mediums who founded the Christian creed—“God is\\nLove. That heaven is a place and a state which man may\\nenjoy when denuded of his flesh-body.”\\nMy heart’s thought and desire is to gather in all men of all\\ndivisional creeds to subscribe to our common faith. To effect\\nthis, a concrete foundation . must be laid, by forming a\\nspiritualistic creed. Then there would be a oneness of\\nopinion, a oneness of action, a concentration of power, by men\\nin the churches, with men out of the churches. Men in the\\nchurches would bring their families and their church com¬\\npanions to spiritualistic gatherings, instead of avoiding them\\nas at present; men of the churches would then distribute\\nspiritualistic literature as they do not at present. Then the\\ntens of thousands of our population, would be operated upon\\non a life-question, as they now are on any national question,\\nirrespective of sectional opinions, the intrusion of which in\\ngreat gatherings of the people is at once put down.\\nSuch a creed is easily formed, and I have no objection to be\\none of a committee to draw it up, for the sanction of and\\nadoption by Spiritualists.

There is, probably, soundness in this\\nadvice, as it may be well to be careful not to needlessly arouse\\nthe enmity of the sects. But it may not be out of place ,\\'for\\none to observe that, finding the teachings of Spiritualism do not\\nuphold as necessary for belief many of the dogmas of the\\nchurches, I was led to read the New Testament, to discover if\\nany other interpretation could be found respecting the doc¬\\ntrine of Christ’s righteousness and death, than is commonly\\nreceived, as relating to the saving of souls by faith therein.\\nI was in consequence led on to conclude that, scripturally, His\\npersonal righteousness and death or atonement, referred to His\\nmission to redeem the Jews from Mosaic institutions and\\nordinations into His gospel, as a higher dispensation of truth\\nand love ; and that men are benefited by Him, not as by any\\nsaving faith in His earthly substituted and atoning merits,\\nbut by embracing in their lives the spirit of truth and love,\\nwhich He both manifested and taught. Hence was He also\\na “ light to lighten the Gentiles ;” and perceiving all this, I\\nbecame satisfied the personal gospel or teaching of Jesus is not\\nreally opposed to, but is in harmony with the high teachings\\nof Spiritualism. But for this discovery I may have concluded\\nSpiritualism to be opposed to Christianity, as many do.\\nStoke Newington, May 17th, 1870. W.Y.\\nSir,—I am one of a rather numerous class who believe that\\nthere is some truth in “ Spiritualism,” but who1 yet think it is\\nmixed up with a large amount of error—in fact that the error\\npreponderates greatly.

Each child of the Divine, reveals more of the\\nDivine than the world knew before; each unit of humanity\\nbom into the world is a new revelation of the All-Father.\\nThe finite is of and from the Infinite ; his finite brother can¬\\nnot reveal God to Him, for God is within Him, and He reveals\\nHimself.\\nHumanity’s mind being part of the Infinite Mind, of a\\nnecessity it yields to truth, when truth meets it in the special\\nchannel Divine Wisdom has cut for it; therefore discussion,\\nby which many of the facets of the diamond are shown, must\\nresult in good ; for no being can be wilfully blind to himself,\\nthough he may for a time refuse to tell his brethren that\\nthough once he was blind, yet now he can see.\\nDeity is unchangeable. He is the same to day as yesterday.\\nHe still shines upon us in the golden beams of the glorious sun,\\nin the silvery rays of the crystal moon-, and in the sparkling\\nglitter of the far-off stars—day unto day uttereth knowledge\\n—night unto night, showeth forth praise. He speaks to us\\nnow, as of old, in the still small voice of the zephyr, and in\\nthe hoarse roar of the storm; in the chirp of the grasshopper,\\nand the shrill trumpeting of the elephant; in the sweet music\\nof the nightingale’s voice, and in the hum of the bee. There\\nis no speech nor language in which his voice is not\\nheard.\\nHumanity of to-day cannot see God through eyes which\\nsaw 2,000 years ago, nor hear him through ears of 2,000 years\\nsince ; to suppose so, is to suppose the present shut out from\\nthe Divine : and we are able only to perceive him, when Moses,\\nIsaiah, Jesus, Peter, or Paul speaks.\\nWhence came humanity ? How came humanity ? Man\\nknows his presence in the world is due to the never-failing\\naction of a Divine law. Whence came the power to walk l\\nThat phase of the child’s manifestation was within the germ\\nof the child—a part of the Divine plan, and, without the\\nDivine life fo sustain it, no power to walk could exist.\\nWhence came the child’s intelligence ? There is but one\\nsource of intelligence, and that source is the Author of it;\\nnor is it possible to effect a separation between the source and\\nthe stream, and the stream then to continue.\\nThought lies behind all forms, and controls all forces. Be¬\\nfore the visible stellar systems were formed, the plan of\\nthem, their form, and ultimate, existed in the mind of the\\nOmniscient. As they now are, they are but the externali-\\nsation of the thought. Every object we see is but the\\nexternalisation of a thought of God : the grass upon which\\nwe tread, is an evergreen expression of tender thought; the\\nflowers, with their varied hues and odours, are thoughts per¬\\nfumed by the breath of God ; the songs of the birds are\\nmusical thoughts filling the world with the harmony of His\\npresence. And man?—Man is the externalisation of the\\nnoblest thought of which Deity is capable; the image of Him¬\\nself is man.\\nCan any thought of God’s be evil ? Can any manifestation\\nof God’s thought be evil ? The ultimate of all Deity’s work\\nis perfection, but the end is not yet. Deity works in his own\\nway.\\nHe thinks to make man in His image. The first expression\\nof His thought (of which we are conscious) appears in a con¬\\ndensation of the elemental forces into (what we call) nebulous\\nmatter; then the relatively concrete globe; next, the\\nfirst and comparatively imperfect vegetable life; then\\nthe animal; afterwards the more perfect herb and the more\\nperfect animal; then the relatively perfect herb and animal;\\nand then—man.\\nThe Divine thought was to make Man. Why did he not\\nmake him at once ? Why does not an acorn become a full-\\ngrown oak immediately it is planted in the ground? Why\\nneed it be put in the ground at all ? Why does not the child\\nbecome a man immediately it is born ? Why need there be\\nsuch a birth at all ? Why ? Because the law is—all higher\\nforms are preceded by lower ones, out of which the higher\\nare developed.\\nThe Omnipotent manifested His thought through matter in\\nits earlier stages in the most perfect manner possible; but\\nages after, the expression of the thought would appear to\\nsuperficial observers more perfect, and still more so in future\\nages.\\nAnd thus, as matter has been educated by the Divine Spirit\\n—first, the herb, having life without intelligence (as far as we\\nknow) ; next, the animal, with life and wiconscious intelli¬\\ngence ; and then man, with life and conscious intelligence—\\nso is intelligence, or man, being educated.\\nMan is dual natured, having animal unconscious intelli¬\\ngence, instinct (in man called feeling), and Divine percep¬\\ntion (called intuition), which is conscious intelligence. This\\nconscious intelligence has to develop the selfish animal\\ninstinct or feeling into the nnselfish or Divine, that the end\\nof life—^conscious happiness—may be attained.\\nObserve the child. Its first manifestations are purely\\nanimal, selfish ; all it sees it wants ; it obtains possession,\\nand is happy ; by-and-bye its friends call it greedy, and shun\\nit. This gives pain; it then divides its possession with others ;\\nthis gives a higher pleasure, because more spiritual; it is\\nthen called unselfish. A continued repetition of the experience\\nreveals to it that to be unselfish, to distribute, brings the\\nhighest happiness.\\nAs with the child, so with man. Humanity, first selfish, as\\nit is now; then unselfish, as it will be. But this can only\\nbe attained by teaching the truth; and this, the present\\nsystem cannot, will not do. All the so-called religion of the\\npresent is founded upon selfishness, and maintained by brnte\\nforce. Might is right. Those get who have the power ; those\\nkeep who can. All are taught that they can get rid of their\\nselfishness by shifting it to the shoulders of Him who lived\\nmselfishly\\' (2,000 years since), to show each that such a life\\nis possible.\\nThe earth, and the fulness thereof, which is the Lord’s, and\\ntherefore equally humanity’s, is largely appropriated by the\\nmen and their Mends, who say they are divinely appointed\\n(by Him who had not where to lay his head) to teach their\\nbrethren the lesson He taught the rich young man, who\\nasked what he should do to inherit eternal life, viz., “ Sell\\nall that thou hast and give to the poor.” Do they do as they\\nteach ? Nay, rather they employ lawyers to make laws to\\nlegalise their selfishness; they employ judges to direct\\npunishment to those who infringe such laws, and policemen\\nand jailors to inflict the punishment; and soldiers, with\\ncannon, rifle, sword, and bayonet to overawe the people, who\\notherwise would insist upon their rights.\\nThis religion of coveteousness, the expression of the present\\ndevelopment of the world, is the outgrowth of the animal\\nselfishness imperfectly controlled by intelligence. To over¬\\ncome it, let every man who feels he is one, have nought to do\\nwith the thing; but living true to his internal convictions\\nof truth, though it bring upon him (in the present state) per¬\\nsecution, tribulation, and death, let him be at once a living\\nprotest against the self-degrading impositions of mystical\\nreligion, which is soul-bondage, and let him be an example\\nof what man is when the angel-dictates of his divine nature\\nare complied with. This action will hasten the time “ when\\nall men shall know the Lord,” and then will be that millenium\\nso long foretold, so earnestly worked for, by all men in every\\nage and of every clime, in which all will fulfil the simple\\nprecept so faithfully exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth, and\\ntaught by his bosom friend John, namely :\\n“Brethren, love one another!”\\nC. W. Pearce.\\n6, Cambridge-road, Kilburn, N.W.\\nSir,—I would not now have troubled you but to correct\\nthree errors that somehow slipped into my letter in your last\\nissue ; they influence the sense materially. \\' In the first para¬\\ngraph,-instead of “ all existence,’’ read “ all evidence.\" In the\\nsecond, for “ inspired,” read “insphered,” and in the last para¬\\ngraph for “ or equally honest,” read “ i/-equally honest.”\\nAs my pen is in hand, and you intimate that there will not\\nbe another opportunity for some time, allow me room for a\\nJune 15, 1870.\\nTHE SPIRITUALIST.\\n79\\nfew lines in reply to Mr. Pearce’s letter in your last. As I\\nmust be brief, pardon me if I seem a little dogmatic.\\nIf religion is to be taught in any form there must be a\\ncreed, and in some sense a sectarian one. “ I believe in one\\nGod,” that is a creed, and as the question is one of pure\\nspeculation, men will differ in their opinions upon it. Hence\\nvarious sections or sects. The fullest charity is compatible\\nwith any difference of opinion. I deny Mr. Pearce’s “ theo¬\\nretical definition of religion.” When religion becomes a set\\nof duties, it ceases to be religion, and sinks from the spiritual\\nto the moral plane. It is of no use applying our mensura-\\ntive perception to a subject, which from its infinite nature can\\nonly be approached by the ideal faculty. Spontaneity is the\\nchief element in all religious action.\\nI wish Mr. Pearce would not think so much about “ what\\nthey say,” but about what the Bible says. I “believe the\\nBible to be the inspired word of God;” but I am not therefore\\nto believe that God would supply finite men with infinite\\nintelligence. Mr. Pearce ought to see that we can never know\\nanything about infinite intelligence, the relation of the finite\\nto the infinite is a problem yet unsolved by ontological science,\\nand therefore all we can know must be conditioned, and\\nGod’s revelation to us must have a relation to us as finite and\\nrelative beings. And every “well-read man knows ’’ (as Mr.\\nPearce has it), or ought to know, that therein lyeththe sublime\\nphilosophy of Christianity—God manifest in man. Christ is\\nthe everlasting manifestation of God, “ the high and lofty One\\nwhose name is holy,” and yet He stands at the door of every\\nsick, worn, spirit, using the melting words, “ Come unto me\\nall ye that are weary.”\\nTo conclude. As a Spiritualist, I find the truth and potency\\nof the Christian philosophy in its application. It is of no use\\nfor Mr. Pearce to write about a. council that has sat, or may\\nbe sitting, upon it. He might, as well talk against a specific\\nfor a disease, on account of its not being in harmony with\\northodox treatment. The question would remain—Does it\\newe?

CHILD\\'S CIRCLE—THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOICE MANIFESTATIONS—\\nMOVEMENT OF SOLID OBJECTS BY SPIRIT POWER—SPIRIT IDENTITY-\\nJOCULAR MANIFESTATIONS—DIRECT SPIRIT WRITING.\\nDuring the past three years much has been published in the\\nspiritual periodicals, about the wonderful physical manifesta¬\\ntions obtained through the mediumship of Mr. Edward Childs,\\nof 21, Offord-street, Caledonian-road, Islington, N. At his circle\\nchairs, stools, and other heavy articles are carried about the\\nroom by the spirits, who also speak with audible voices, play\\nmusical instruments, and produce direct spirit drawings and\\nwritings. Several members of the Dialectical Society have\\nbeen present at the stances, and the manifestations have been\\nwitnessed by many scores of people; some of the most re¬\\nmarkable phenomena seen at the circle have been published in\\ndifferent numbers of Human Nature.\\nUntil two years ago, Mr. Edward Childs knew little or\\nnothing of Spiritualism, and had never been to a spirit circle,\\nalthough his brother, Mr. George Childs, was well acquainted\\nwith the subject, and was moreover a writing and drawing\\nmedium. Mr. Edward Childs considered the whole subject a\\ndelusion. One evening early in May, 1868, at the conclusion\\nof a seance under Mrs. Everitt’s mediumship, held in the\\nhouse of Mr. George Childs, Mr. Edward Childs entered the\\nroom, and stopped to supper with the other guests. While\\nthere he saw a little table move towards Mrs. Everitt, with\\nnobody touching it, and loud raps spelt out “ George William,”\\nthe name of a little nephew of his own, in the spirit world.\\nThese things considerably excited his curiosity.\\nA.few days later—May 16th, 1868—he sat alone at a table,\\ntrying to obtain manifestations by himself, and he heard faint\\nscratching and other noises, which became louder when his\\nbrother sat with him. Raps then again spelt out “ George\\nWilliam,” the name of the little son of Mr. George Childs,\\nand afterwards they spelt out some kind messages to “ Pa,\\ndear,” and “ Ma, dear.” The little communicant also gave\\nproofs of personal identity, by reminding his father and\\nmother of little occurrences they had forgotten, such as how\\nthey used to play at “ postman ” with him, and how he de¬\\nlivered letters after giving double knocks at the folding doors\\nof the back room. The child was six or seven years old when\\nhe died. Some conversation took place, to the effect that the\\nmediumistic power possessed by Mr. Edward Childs was a\\nserious thing, and required care in its development, upon\\nwhich the message was given—“ God will lead you through, if\\nyou wish it. You will have other powers if you are faithful.”\\nMr. Edward Childs was advised in another message, not to sit\\nalone for manifestations, or with anybody but his brother\\nGeorge.\\nOther sittings then took place occasionally, and some low\\nspirits were sometimes at work who indulged in a little hard\\nswearing; their influence was removed from the medium by\\nmeans of mesmeric passes, made by Mr. George Childs, over\\nhis brother, under the guidance of higher spirits. Once, when\\nMr. Edward Childs sat by himself for manifestations, he re¬\\nceived the message—“ Why do you sit alone 1 You were told\\nnot to do so. If you seek such things you will get a class of\\nspirits round you that you will not be able to get rid of any\\nmore.—Samuel.” This “ Samuel ’’ said that he was a clergyman\\nin earth life. However, in spite of these warnings, Mr. Childs\\nsat again by himself during a thunderstorm, and had a mes¬\\nsage containing rough language and swearing. He narrated\\nthis to his brother next day, and his brother went into a room\\nalone to pray for advice, after which he received the following\\nmessage :—“ Have patience—be firm. Have assurance and\\nfaith in your God. Be very calm ; your brother and you will\\nbe freed from this evil spirit.”\\nOn the 4th June, 1868, Mr. George Childs was told,\"through\\nhis writing mediumship, to invite an old friend and Spiritua¬\\nlist, Mr. Thomas Jones, of 34, Rah ere-street, Goswell-road, to\\nsit with them that evening, and they would get something re¬\\nmarkable in the shape of direct spirit writing. They required\\npaper, pencil, and darkness for this manifestation, which is\\nnow common enough at spirit circles. In a short time the\\npencil was heard at work, and some sheets of paper were\\nheard to fall under the table; other sheets were folded up,\\nand thrown at one or other of the sitters. When a .light was\\nstruck the sheets under the table were found to contain\\nfailures, in the shape of imperfect sentences, but the others\\ncontained affectionate messages from George William to\\n“ Dear Pa.” After supper, another sitting was held, at which\\nMrs. Childs was present, and the little spirit wrote—“ Dear\\nMa, bless you, I do not forget you.” Mr. George Childs asked\\nhim whether he remembered and would write a pet name which\\nhe was called by at home ; a paper was then thrown at his\\nfeet, on which was written, “ Cub, dear Pa.” This was true,\\nand the name was given him because his hair in long flowing\\nringlets gave him a lion-like appearance.\\nThe circle was then instructed to sit regularly for the spirit\\nvoice, and it met often for that purpose. All this time plenty\\nof messages by direct writing and other methods were given.\\nOn one occasion, in the dark, something struck Mr. George\\nChilds in the face ; he picked it up, and found it to be a piece\\nof paper with a flower inside, and on the paper was written—\\n“ Here’s the flower from Uncle’s coat; he is almost asleep from\\nfear. G. W. C.” Mr. Edward Childs then missed the flower\\nfrom his button-hole; he acknowledged that he did feel\\nalarmed, and had been sitting with his coat over his head.\\nHis brother expostulated with him, but he replied—“ It’s no\\nuse ; if I sit for a hundred years I shall not be able to get over\\nit.” On another occasion, by direct writing, the following\\nmesage was given—“ Do not speak, dears, when I write—it\\ndisturbs me.” Silence assists direct spirit writing, yet it is not\\ngood to aid in, the production of the spirit voice, “for,” says\\nMr. George Childs, “ now, when the voices are so strong that\\nthey can be heard all over the house, anxiety on the part of\\nthe sitters will prevent each voice from developing itself into\\nanything like a loud tone ; we are constantly told to converse\\namong ourselves, when anything is about to be done.”\\nDuring the time that the circle sat for the voices, accord¬\\ning to instructions a light paper tube, as described on page 80\\nof this issue, was placed on the table, for at first such tubes\\nmuch aid the spirits in producing audible voices, although in\\ntime they may be abolished. The early attempts to speak\\nwere very interesting, and. were often heard by the company ;\\nthe power gradually increased, and it became plain that the\\nspirit was trying to say “ Pa,” but the sound was exactly like\\nthat made by puffing out a candle. After one of these attempts,\\na message was written : “ I tried to speak, but Uncle was\\nalarmed.” As the medium became more passive, the power\\nincreased. At last, on the 23rd of July, 1868, the words “ Pa !\\nMa ! ” were clearly pronounced, and Mr. George Childs, on\\nhearing these loved words coming from beyond the grave,\\nsaid, in a state of great excitement, “ Pa 1 Ma! There !\\nThere ! I heard it! ” The delight was reciprocal, for little\\nGeorge William knew by the exclamations of his father that\\nhe had made himself heard, and began beating the table in¬\\ncessantly and frantically with the paper tube, as if he could\\nnot sufficiently control his delight. The voice gradually in¬\\ncreased in strength, and at last it resembled a strong whisper.\\nThe voice was not, and is not, that of the little boy as he spoke\\nin the flesh, but the proofs of identity given at different times,\\nquite satisfied \"Mr. and Mrs. Childs that they were in direct\\ncommunication with their son in the next world.\\nAfter a time another voice, and a strong one, was indis¬\\ntinctly heard, and the owner thereof by raps on the table,\\nspelt out his name as “Amos Ferguson, a friend.” He then\\nasked George William to speak for him, and said that he was\\na Scotchman and a soldier ; he lived at the same time as\\nRobert Burns, the poet, and saw him once while in the body.\\nAmos taught little George to speak a few sentences in the\\nScotch dialect through the tube, and when those present could\\nnot understand them, he spelt out the words in full. Amos,\\nafter attempts, extending over two or three weeks, was first\\nable to make himself heard clearly on the 13th August, 1868,\\nbut at the present time his voice is not louder than a strong\\nwhisper. He began to attend the meetings of the circle re¬\\ngularly, and at first was very respectful and somewhat formal\\nto those present; he usually closed with a “ Good night,\\nMadam,” to Mrs. Childs. After a time he grew more familiar,\\nand now calls Mr. Childs “ George,” and Mrs. Childs “ Ellen.”\\nAll the members of the circle find him to be very truthful, and\\nnow look upon him as a most sincere friend ; once, after tell¬\\ning him of their confidence in him, he replied—“ I am glad\\nyou understand me, for I have been to other circles, and was\\nrepulsed, being considered an evil spirit.” Amos after a time\\nbegan to produce direct writing, but usually finished by\\nthrowing down the pencils, and breaking the points; Mr.\\nChilds expostulated with him, but on one occasion remarked,\\n“ If you give me a good drawing, I don’t mind the points\\nbeing broken.” A good drawing was then made, after which\\nAmos said—“ I suppose you don’t mind my keeping your\\nWord. There they go. Ha 1 Ha ! Ha ! ”—and down went\\nthe pencils on the floor. Mr. Childs said—“Amos ! Amos ! ”\\nHe replied—“ Can you tell me why you are like an actor who\\nhas lost his cue ? ” The riddle being given up, Amos said—\\n“ Because I have spoilt your points.” On one occasion when\\nthose present were talking about how shocked many of the\\noutside public are at the idea of spirits cracking jokes and\\nasking riddles, Amos made some remarks to the effect that the\\nordinary notions about disembodied spirits are very erroneous;\\nspirits are not furnished with great pairs of wings, and do not\\ngo off to a place of happiness all at once.\\nMr. Austin, a friend of the Messrs. Childs, was afterwards\\ninvited to come to the circle to see the wonderful manifesta¬\\ntions, and immediately there was a great increase of power.\\nIt was supposed that Mr. Austin was a medium before he\\ncame to the circle, because on one occasion he had seen the\\nspirit of his deceased aunt. The second time Mr. Austin sat\\nat the circle a third spirit, who gave the name of “ Sancto,”\\nmade his voice heard, and asked for a concertina. This was\\nfurnished him, and a few minutes afterwards he played upon\\nit “ The Soldier’s Chorus ” from Gounod’s Faust. He after¬\\nwards produced good music both on the flute and violin. He\\ngave his history, and said that he was born at Nice, and was\\nin eaath-life a gentlemen amateur musician. Articles weigh¬\\ning from a few ounces to thirty or forty pounds were often\\ncarried noiselessly about the room while the music was going\\non, and all the members of the circle were holding each others\\nhands. The growth of the spirit power to such a marvellous\\nextent, at first caused a little alarm, but no harm was done to\\nanybody, nor was anything ever broken. Whenever the\\nspirits asked anybody to hold out a hand, something would\\nalways be placed in it with unerring accuracy, showing that\\nthe spirits could see perfectly in pitch darkness.\\nThree more spirits were afterwards introduced by Amos, and\\ntheir voices are very powerful. One of these was “ Joe,”\\nwho describes himself as an agricultural labourer; the second\\nwas Ebenezer Wyatt, who speaks with a whining voice, is\\nvery jocular, and produces extraordinary music by means of\\na piece of paper and a comb. With this primitive instrument\\nhe often accompanies Sancto, while the latter plays the violin\\nor flute. Ebenezer Wyatt first spoke on the 8th of April,\\n1869. The third spirit, “ Alonzo Bates,” was introduced by\\nAmos on the 3rd of June, 1869, as follows :—“ My boy, I will\\nwith your permission, introduce another one who was a\\nhumble individual upon earth, indeed he was a street singer,\\nbut he possessed capabilities which were not developed here.\\nHe will amuse you very much by his singing and reciting, and\\nI have no doubt you will 16am from him too. I am sure, if\\nyou will allow him to come, he will, as I do, bless you for per¬\\nmitting it, for it will help him to progress.” Afterwards,\\nanother friend of Mr. Edward Childs, Mr. Macmillan, was\\ninvited to the circle. He proved to be a medium, and his\\npresence enabled another spirit, an Irishman, Dennis O’ Bryan,\\nto make his voice heard. The povver of the voices is now so\\nstrong that the paper tubes have been abolished. The voices\\noften can be heard all over the house and in the street out¬\\nside. Sometimes they have been feebly heard in broad day¬\\nlight, and they are often heard near Mr. Edward Childs when\\nhe is out walking at night, or when the light is not strong.\\nSoon after Mr. Austin joined the circle, the little boy,\\nGeorge William, ceased to come to it and speak audibly,\\nand the other spirits say that he has now risen too high in\\nspirit life to be able to make his voice heard by mortals. The\\nlast time he spoke, Mrs. Emma Hardinge was there. She saw\\nand described him. Mr. W. D. Meers, seeing-medium, who is\\nnow in New Zealand, also attended the circle before he left\\nEngland, and saw the spirit-child, whom he had also known in\\nearth life. The spirits said that while the child came and\\nspoke at the circle, attracted there by love, he could have\\nbeen higher in spirit-life had he chosen, and since then he\\nhas risen considerably.-\\nOne evening in April last, Amos remarked, “ You said you\\nwould like some physical manifestations. You shall have\\nthem.” Many were given duiing the evening, and then Amos\\nsaid—1 You shall have a literary curiosity. Let me have a\\npencil. I will give Ted something to put his initials on.”\\nThe Irishman, O’Bryan, then began talking to keep the\\nmembers of the circle in a passive state. Shortly after¬\\nwards Amos said, “ I have put him to sleep, don’t say a word,”\\nand a few seconds later Amos ordered a light to be struck.\\nMr. Edward Childs then said—“ I have been asleep, I do\\nthink,” and on looking up to the ceiling the initials of\\'Mr.\\nEdward Childs, and the name of Amos Ferguson were seen\\nto be written theieon, Mr. Childs having been taken up to the\\nceiling in the trance state, and made to do the writing.\\nWhite finger-marks on the ceiling caused by the right and\\nleft hands of Mr. Childs having rubbed away some of the\\nsmoke stains produced by the gas, were also visible. The\\nceiling was ten feet from the floor. Mr. Childs, to this day,\\nhas no recollection of being moved, or of having done the\\nwriting.\\nMr. George Childs has, from the first, very wisely kept a\\ndiary in which he has noted down all the facts witnessed\\nand communications received during the development of\\nhis brother’s mediumship. To him, consequently, we are\\nindebted for the foregoing particulars. He says that there is\\nsomething very remarkable in the way spirits place things in\\nthe hands of those present, and he adds : “ If I give out of\\nmy hands anything to another person, although it is done\\ninstantaneously, yet we both convey a sensation and percep¬\\ntion of weight to each other—I in giving the weight, and he\\nin taking it. I do not release the object till the other person\\nhas it firmly. There is nothing of this in connection with\\nthe articles the spirits move about, the object is evidently\\ncontrolled differently and more completely.” Similar facts\\nare mentioned in the little pamphlet by Mr. William Howitt,\\non “ The throwing of stones by Spirits,” which pamphlet is\\nstill in print. In spiritualistic literature the instances where\\nheavy articles, after being moved through the air with the\\nutmost velocity, come to rest as if they had no more weight\\nthan a feather, are very numerous, and such things are often\\nwitnessed at those spirit circles where powerful physical\\nmanifestations are obtained.\\nMr. Edward Childs and Mr. Austin were very old friends\\nof each other, and frequently together, yet the first evening\\nthey sat with each other for spiritual manifestations, the\\npresence of Mr; Austin caused Mr. Childs intolerable pain,\\nshowing that ordinary conditions were changed under the\\ncircumstances. At further sittings the painful,reeling quickly\\npassed away. One night, at the close of a seance, Mr. Austin\\nsaid, “ Try if you can find out where the voice comes from.”\\nMr. George Childs then heard Sancto’s voice, coming appa¬\\nrently from Mr. Austin’s breast. He accordingly placed his\\near there, and then the voice seemed to come from Mr.\\nAustin’s back. Mr. Childs then put his head there, and then\\nSancto’s voice came apparently from his brother, two yards\\noff, and said, “Ha! ha! ha! catch me if you can.’” Fear,\\nor want of passivity, on the part of the medium, will often\\nsuddenly stop the voices, and if the spirits chance to be using\\nthe paper tubes at the time, they will fall. Anxiety on the\\npart of fresh visitors to the circle will often very consider¬\\nably reduce the strength of the voices. Since the first out¬\\nbreak of Mr. Childs’s mediumship, the circle has sat for mani¬\\nfestations once or twice a week with much regularity. The\\npower has been taken away from the medium three or four\\ntimes for short internals, and then no manifestations could be\\nobtained; in two or three cases this was done because sitting\\ntoo much weakened the medium, and sometimes no reason was\\ngiven by the‘spirits for the temporary removal of the power.\\nAs regards the direct spirit-writing obtained at Mr. Childs’s\\ncircle, it is done as usual with extraordinary velocity, long\\nsentences being written out almost instantaneously, and some¬\\ntimes when both paper and pencil are in mid air.\\nIn closing, it may be remarked that Mr. Childs is not a\\nprofessional medium; neither he nor his friends derive any\\nincome in any way from the manifestations which are pro¬\\nduced in their presence. Experienced Spiritualists accustomed\\nto the phenomena nbw common in those private circles where\\nvoice-manifestations are obtained, know them in this case to\\nbe genuine, but, as stated in our published advice to outsiders,\\ninvestigators should begin by testing the genuine character of\\nthe raps, table motions, and other things which are obtain¬\\nable in daylight, and as dark circles offer such opportunities for\\ndeception, they should be held only by those who know each\\nother.\\nDetails of many of the remarkable seances which have been\\nheld under the mediumship of Mr. E. Childs have been written\\nby Dr. Dixon, of 8, Great Ormond-street, W.C., and published\\nin some of the back numbers of Human Nature.\\nANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.\\nW. R. T., Isle of Wight.—A.

Each individual\\nshould witness and test them personally, and\\nbelieve nothing until the absolute knowledge\\nis gained that denial is impossible.\\nEVIDENCE THAT SPIRITUALISM DESERVES INVES¬\\nTIGATION.\\nThe testimony of reliable and respectable wit¬\\nnesses . that the phenomena of Spiritualism are\\nactual facts, and not imposture or delusion, has of\\nlate years so accumulated as to possess very great\\nweight. In the case of Lyon v. Home, Mr. Robert\\n\\' Chambers, Mr. 0. E. Varley, Dr. Gully, Mr.\\' and\\nMrs. S. C. Hall, and others, all made affidavits\\nstrongly in favour of Mr Home. The following\\nwas .the affidavit of Mr. O. F. Varley, C.E.,\\nF.R.G.S.,\\'M.R.I..\\n“ I, Cromwell Fleetwood Varley, of Fleetwood House,\\nBeckenham, in the County of Kent, Esquire, make oath\\nand say as follows:—■\\n“I haveheen a student of electricity, chemistry, and\\nnatural philosophy for twenty-six years, and a tele¬\\ngraphic engineer by profession for twenty-one years,\\nand I am the consulting electrician of the Atlantic Tele¬\\ngraph Company, and of the Electric and International\\nCompany.\\n“About nine or ten years ago, having had my atten¬\\ntion directed to the subject of Spiritualism by its spon¬\\ntaneous and unexpected development in my own family\\nin the form of clairvoyant visions and communications,\\nI determined to test the truth of the alleged physical\\nphenomena to the best of my ability, and to ascertain,\\nif possible, the nature of the force which produced them.\\n“ Accordingly, about eight years ago, I called on Mr.\\nHome, the defendant in this suit, and stated that I had\\nnot yet witnessed any of the physical phenomena, but\\nthat I was a scientific man and wished to investigate\\nthem carefully.\\n“ He immediately gave me every facility for the pur¬\\npose, and desired me to satisfy myself in every possible\\nway, and I have been with him on divers occasions\\nwhen the phenomena have occurred. I have examined\\nand tested them with him and with others, under con¬\\nditions of my own choice, under a bright light, and have\\nmade the most jealous and searching scrutiny. I have\\nbeen, since then, for seven months in America, where\\nthe subject attracts great attention and study, and where\\nit is cultivated by some of the ablest men, and having\\nexperimented with and compared the forces with elec¬\\ntricity and magnetism, and after having applied me-\\nchanical-and mental tests, I entertain no doubt whatever\\nthat the manifestations which I have myself examined\\nwere not due to the operation of any of the recognised\\nphysical laws of nature, and that there has been present\\non the occasions above-mentioned some intelligence\\nother than that of the medium and observers.\\n“The subject of course offers many opportunities and\\ninducements for fraud, and I only speak of what I have\\nmyself seen and tested. Since my acquaintance with\\nMr. Home began I have pursued the enquiry, and I have\\nfound engaged in it able, learned, and scientific men,\\nwho are convinced as I am, that the physical manifesta¬\\ntions are but the introduction to an-extensive field of\\nmental and physical knowledge which will in a great\\nmeasure explain and reconcile the beliefs of all ages and\\nnations. I know of several instances both in Europe\\nand America in which this course of study has awak¬\\nened the perception of the purest and loftiest truths and\\nprinciples. There have been no doubt cases in which\\nthe intellect has been too feeble for the stimulus, and\\nhas been overpowered by it, just as frequently results\\nfrom excessive application to religion and other exciting\\ntopics, but such cases have not come within my own\\nobservation.\\n“Mr. Home, like several other non-professional me¬\\ndiums whose cases I have studied, was passive during\\nthe occurrence of the manifestations. He, like the\\nother mediums, is extremely susceptible to external in¬\\nfluences, and has a mind better suited to receive impres¬\\nsions than to prosecute enquiries. I willingly testify my\\nentire conviction Of his truthfulness and honesty.\\n“ 0. F. Yarley\\nIt also came out in Hie evidence given at the\\ntrial, that Mr. Home had been the invited and un¬\\npaid guest of the Emperor and the Empress of the\\nFrench, the Emperor, Empress, and the late Em-\\n.press Dowager of Russia, the Grand Duke •Con¬\\nstantine,-the King of Prussia, the late King-of.\\nBavaria, the late King of Wurtemburg, and the,\\nQueen of Holland. Mr. Home says that, all his\\nlife he has never taken a farthing of pay for his\\nseances. In March, 1869, the Spiritual Magazine\\ngaye the names of the following gentlemen as\\nthose who have long been investigating the sub¬\\nject:—\\n; “Cromwell F. Yarley, Esq., Fleetwood-house, Becken.-\\nham Alfred B. Wallace, Esq., 9, St. Mark’s-crescent,\\nN.W.; Professor De Morgan, 91, Adelaide-road, N.W.;\\nCaptain Drayson, B.A., Woolwich; Dr. J. M. Gully,\\nThe Priory, Great Malvern: Dr. J. J. G. Wilkinson, 4,\\nSt. John’s-wood-villas, N.W.; Dr. Dixon, 8, Great Or-\\nmond-street, W.C.: S. C.

M.\\nWilkinson, Esq.; \" Oakfleld, Kilbum; Lord Adare, 5,\\nBuckingham-gate; The Master of Lindsay, Grosvenor-\\n.square.”,,\\nMrs. De Morgan has written a book, entitled\\nFrom Matter to Spirit (Longmans), where she\\ngives many\\'-interesting particulars, the result of\\nten years’ experience in Spiritualism. Professor\\nDe Morgan, President of the Mathematical Society\\nof London, in his preface to the boob, says:—\\n“ I am perfectly convinced that I have both seen and\\nheard, in a manner which should make unbelief impos¬\\nsible, things called spiritual, which cannot be taken by\\na rational being to be capable of explanation by impos¬\\nture, coincidence, or mistake. : So far I feel the ground\\nfirm under me.” •\\nDr. Hooker, in his opening address^ as President\\nof the British Association at Norwich \\'in l868,\\nspoke very highly of the scientific attainm\\'ents-of\\nMr. Alfred R. Wallace, F.L.S. Mr. Wallace is-an\\navowed Spiritualist. . Professor Hare, of Phila¬\\ndelphia, the inventor of the Hare’s Galvanic Bat¬\\ntery, once refused to witness spiritual phenomena,\\nalleging that Faraday’s’“unconscious muscular\\naction’’-theory explained all the facts. A friend\\nwrote to him detailing things fie had seen which\\nwere inexplicable by that theory. Hare at once,\\nlike a sensible man, went to see for himself. The\\nresiilt was that he came into communication with\\nSome of his own departed relatives. He .then\\nmade mechanical telegraphic machines, which\\nwere intelligently worked by spirits wlule the\\napparatus was screened from the sight of the-\\'\\nmedium, and he wrote a boob recording all these\\nfacts. That book is now in the British Museum\\nLibrary. Judge Edmonds, of New York, is another\\nvery eminent American Spiritualist, who has also\\nwritten interesting books on the subject. Recently,\\nin England, Viscount Adare has written a book\\nbearing testimony to the truth of Spiritualism, and\\nit has a preface by Lord Dunraven. This book is\\nprinted for private circulation only, which is an\\nerror in judgment. Valuable evidence in favour\\nof Spiritualism is given by John Wesley and his\\nfamily; for spirit rapping and movements of\\nwooden materials by invisible agency occurred in\\ntheir own house. Documentary evidence of what\\nthey witnessed was drawn up and signed on the\\nspot, and is published in Southey’s Life of Wesley.\\nSignor G. Damiani, a Sicilian gentleman living\\nat Clifton, has written a pamphlet, still in print,\\nin which he severely censures Professor Tyndall,\\nMr. G. H. Lewes, and others like them, for refus¬\\ning to investigate the subject. He further offers a\\nreward of 1,000 guineas to any respectable, \\'scien¬\\ntific ’or educated men, who will investigate the\\nsubject and prove it to be an imposture. The\\nfollowing are his words:—\\n“ I now offer you two challenges.\\n“First, I challenge you, or either of you, or any of\\nthe public who, like you, disbelieve in the genuine cha¬\\nracter of spiritualistic phenomena, to deposit in the\\nhands of any well-known London banker whom you or\\nthey may name, the sum of .five hundred guineas; and\\nI pledge myself to immediately deposit in the same bank\\na like amount,—the ownership of such sum of one thou¬\\nsand guineas to depend upon my proving by evidence\\nsufficient to establish any .fact in history or in a criminal\\nor civil court of justice.\\nFirst—That intelligent communications and answers\\nto questions put, proceed from dead and inert matter in\\na manner inexplicable by any generally recognised law\\nof nature.\\n“ Secondly—That dead and inert matter does move\\nwithout the aid of any mechanical or known chemical\\nagency, and in defiance of all the admitted laws of gravi¬\\ntation.\\n“ Thirdly—That voices appertaining to no one in the\\nflesh are heard to speak and hold rational converse with\\nmen.\\n“A jury of twenty-four gentlemen, twelve to be chosen\\nby each party (such jury to consist exclusively of mem¬\\nbers of the learned, professions and literary men), to\\ndecide whether or not the facts contained in the above\\npropositions are conclusively proved per testes—i.e., by\\nwitnesses of established character. A majority of\\nthe twenty-four to decide. If the verdict be that these\\nfacts have not been established, the thousand guineas\\nare to belong to the party accepting this challenge; if\\nthe verdict be that these facts are established, the thou¬\\nsand guineas to be mine.\\n“ Secondly—Immediately after the above \\'wager being\\ndecided, either way, I offer a like challenge of five hun¬\\ndred guineas (to be met on the other side in like maimer\\nas above)—the ownership of the second sum of one\\nthousand guineas to depend upon the establishment of\\nthe facts contained in the propositions already given, by\\nexperiments conducted, in the actual presence of the twenty-\\nfour gentlemen who have decided the previous wager;\\nthe verdict of the majority to decide in this case likewise.\\n“ In either case, the seances are to be conducted in any\\npublic or private building which the jury may select,\\nand which may be available for the purpose.\\n“The result of these challenges (if accepted and de¬\\ncided) to be advertised by the victorious party, at the\\nexpense of the defeated party, in all the London daily\\npapers.\\n“ I hope this is plain English.\\n“Awaiting a reply to this letter, and to the challenge\\nwith which it concludes, I am, gentlemen; your obedient\\nservant, G. Damiani.\\n“Clifton, Oct. 1,1868.\\n“P.S.—Letters addressed ‘Sigr. Damiani, care of\\nManager of West of England and South Wales District\\nBank, Corn-street, Bristol,’ will always reach the writer.”\\nIn addition to\\'the above evidence, there is the\\ntestimony of numbers that the modern spiritual\\nmanifestations are realities. Mr. Hepworth Dixon\\nin his New America estimates the number of Spiri¬\\ntualists in the United States at rather less than\\nthree millions, and this is about the lowest estimate\\nthat anybqdy has made. There are no accurate sta¬\\ntistics, and different authorities vary in their esti-\\n\\'mates frpm three to eleven millions.\\nWhen reports of the speeches of spirits are printed in this\\nJournal,.nom-Bpiritualists should understand that spirits\\nout of the body are wise or foolish, truthful or untruthful,\\njust the same as spirits in the body. Moreover, they are but\\n\\'.individuals, so do not know everything. The statements of a\\nspirjt are but the assertions of an individual; but by com¬\\nparing the statements of many spirits, it may in time, be\\npossible to \\'discover in what points they agree, and to sift\\nout the unreliable communications. Many spirits cannot\\nsee each\\'other, any more than we can see them, cmd as some,\\nof them are thus in different state\\'s of life, it does not follow\\n.that contradictory messages j are therefore untruthful^\\nSpirits are of different religions, consequently their teach¬\\nings do not altogether agreethere is no. more, uniformity\\nin the. next world than in this one. It is the business of thjs\\njournal to report facts, so. we are in no way responsible\\'for\\nthe religious, scientific, or any other teachings given by indi¬\\nvidual spirits.\\nHOW TO FORM SPIRIT CIRCLES.\\nAn experimental trial at home, among family\\nfriends and relatives, often gives the most satis¬\\nfactory evidence of, the reality, of spiritual pheno¬\\nmena. At the same,-time,’as no fully developed\\nmedium is present among those who have never\\nobtained manifestations .before, the probability is\\nthat\\'there will be no results. Nevertheless, it is\\na very common thing for striking manifestations\\nto be obtained in this, way at the first sitting of a\\nfamily circle; - perhaps for every- one successful\\nnew circle thus started without a medium, there,\\nare six or seven failures, but no accurate statistics\\non-this point have yet been collected. , When\\nonce manif estations have been obtained, they will\\ngradually increase in power and reliability at suc¬\\ncessive sittings. The following is a good plan of\\naction:—\\n1. Let the room be of a comfortable temperature, but\\ncool rather than warm—let arrangements be made that\\nnobody shall enter it, and that there ‘shall be no inter¬\\nruption for one hour during the sitting of the icircle.\\nWet, damp, and foggy weather is bad for the production\\nof physical phenomena. ,\\n\\' 2. Let the circle consist of four, five, or six individuals,\\nabout the same number of\\' each sex. Sft round afi un¬\\ncovered wooden table, with all the palms of-the hands\\ntn contact ..with its top surface. Whether,\\'the,hands\\n\\'touch\\' each other or not is usually of no’;importance.’\\nAny. table will do, just large ‘enough to conveniently\\naccommodate the sifters. The removal of a hand from\\nthe-table for a fewfeeconds does no harm, but when one\\nof the sitters breaks:the circle by leaving the table if\\nsometimes,.but not always, very considerably delays the\\nmanifestations.\\n3. Before the sitting begins, place some pointed lead-\\npencils and some sheets of clean writing paper on the\\ntable, to write down any communications that may be\\nobtained.\\n4. People who do nOt.like each other should not sit in,\\nthe same circle, for.such a want of harmony tends to\\nprevent manifestations, except with well-developed\\nphysical mediums; it is not yet known why. Belief or\\nunbelief has no influence on the manifestations, but an\\naerid feeling against them is a weakening influence.\\n6. Before the manifestations begin, it is well to engage\\nin general conversation or in singing, and it is best that\\nneither should be of a frivolous nature. A prayerful,\\nearnest feeling among the members of the circle is likely\\nto attract a higher and more pleasing class of spirits.\\n6. The first symptom of the invisible power at work is\\noften a feeling like a cool wind sweeping over the hands.\\nThe first manifestations will probably be table tiltings or\\nraps.\\n7. When motions of the table or sounds are produced\\nfreely, to avoid confusion, let one person only speak,\\nand talk to the table as to an intelligent being.\\nLet him tell the table that three tilts, or raps mean\\n“Yes,” one means “No,” and two.mean “Doubtful,”\\nand ask whether the arrangement is understood. If\\nthree signals be given in answer, then say, “ If I speak\\nthe letters of the alphabet slowly, will you signal every\\ntime I come to the letter you want, aud spell us out a\\nmessage ? ” Should three signals be given, set to work\\non the plan proposed, and from this time an intelligent\\nsystem of communication is established.\\n8. Afterwards, the .question should be put, “Are we\\nsitting in the.right order to get the best manifestations ?”\\nProbably some members of the circle will then be told\\nto change seats with each other, and the signals will be\\nafterwards strengthened. -Next, ask, “ Who ,is the\\nmedium ? ” When spirits come asserting themselves to\\nbe related or known to anybody present, well-chosen\\nquestions should be put to test the accuracy-of the\\nstatements, as spirits out of the body have all the virtues\\nand all the failings of spirits in the body.\\nPossibly at the first sitting of a circle symptoms\\nof other forms of medinmship than tilts or raps\\nmay make their appearance. Information respect¬\\ning the many kinds of medinmship will be found\\nin Mrs. Professor De Morgan’s book, From Matter\\nto Spirit, published by Longmans; and this is a\\ngood book to read before trying to start a new\\ncircle.\\nThere are in England several very interesting\\ncircles for physical manifestations, where the\\nspirits speak with audible voices, but, unfortu¬\\nnately, total darkness is a necessary condition.\\nNon-spiritualists who are inquiring into the sub¬\\nject should have nothing to do with dark seances,\\nwhich should be held only by those who know\\neach other, since they offer so many facilities for\\nfraud. , When any circle regularly obtains power¬\\nful physical manifestations, they may desire to sit\\nfor the voices. The very slightest glimmer of\\nlight must be excluded from the room, while the\\nmembers of the circle sit round the table in the\\nordinary way. One or two paper tubes, each\\ntwelve or eighteen inches long, with an orifice\\nabout an inch-and-a-halt in diameter, should be\\nplaced on the table. They may be readily made\\nby rolling up a piece ox music and tying a few\\npieces of cotton round the rough tube thus formed.\\nIn the early stages of a voice-circle these tubes\\nare necessary for the use of the spirits, but after¬\\nwards they may be dispensed with except , when\\nthe weather and other conditions are unfavour¬\\nable. When first trying to obtain the voices the\\nspirits may not be able to lift the tubes from the\\ntable, afterwards they often get them up in the\\nair a foot or two and let them drop again. When\\nthey get full control over them they can carry\\nthem about up to the ceiling and to all parts of\\nthe room, and they talk to the members of the\\ncircle often while floating about above their heads.\\nVery beautiful luminous phenomena are some¬\\ntimes shown by the spirits at dark circles. While\\nsitting for the voices, the spirits will tell by the\\nordinary table signals how they are progressing in\\ntheir work of getting control of the tubes.\\nThe good but not expensive\\nCLOTHING ESTABLISHMENT.\\nT.

investigators ^who first examined the phenomena in search of truth  there is evidence that the spirit in the house of the wesley s was on the whole a well meaning  good  natured kind of ghost  mr  s  wesley was not always civil to him   for one night he called him  a deaf and  dumb devil   and told him to leave off frightening the children by making a noise in their ropm    the spirit then in a temper gave one crashing  knock  but kept quiet for the rest of the night  as so rudely requested  mrs  wesley asked the spirit not to disturb her sleep early in the morning  and not to interrupt her at prayers   both requests were faithfully attended to  and she was never again disturbed at the stated hours  emilia wesley  afterwards mrs  harper  was a physical  medium  and this same spirit afterwards occasionally made manifestations in her presence for no less than thirty four years  during the two months the spirit was at epworth the fears of the family respecting the disturbance soon  died away  and mrs  harper  who had longer experience of him than any of the others  at last expressed a doubt as to his being an evil spirit  for tha t these lessonsfbayeioade so profound sntraf they

at the approaching  census the american govern  ment will take steps to collect the much desired evi  dence  what is required to be known is   1  the number of spiritualists not belonging to any other religious denomination  2  the number of spiritualists belonging also to other religious denominations   in the absence of such statistics  the following paragraph from the spiritual magazine contains

nominal are nearly five millions   mr  andrew leigh  ton who visited america in 1865  in his i notes oh spiritualisyn and spiritualists in the united states   published in this magazine  estimated the

and with brass castors  we were  allowed to move it about  and there   certainly   appeated to be  no  secret mechanism in the table itself  or an  any way pdnneoted with it     the cloth having been removed  from the  table  we all sat round it  our hands resting on it   and   entered into conversation upon various subjects  mr  home sat in an easy unconstrained manner   joining in the conversation  at times moving his hands from the table  and generally apparently tmedneerhed     after sitting for some ten or fifteen minutes  a slight vibratioff of the table was felt  and  then   raps were heard  apparently on various parts  of thectable  these raps wered hpard for some time  sometimes more and som etimep legs  distinct  they were heard also  hen  mr  ^home s temds were off the table  the t sceptics  dr  cresswellj mr  bremner  mr  ward  and ourselves  looked in turn under the table at mr  home s legs arid feet during the continuance  of the sitting  and they were quite motionless  the table then rose slightly off the ground and moved up to the persons sitting at one end and the other  and the raps becoming more distinct mr  home stated that a message was about to be given  one of the party repeated the alphabet  and   as the letter required to be used was nairied  raps were heard  the following words were thus formed    we no all that we can to convince yob that we live and that 2 the spiritualist  nov  19  1869  god is dote   at each  letter of the name of god a tremulous motion of the table was perceptible    at mr  home s suggestion one of the sceptics asked that the table should be made light  and to his surprise  when he placed his hand under the edge of the table it moved up as lightly as a sheet of paper  he then said    please let it be heavy   and it required considerable exertion to move it off the ground  each of the sceptics tried this experiment in turn  and with the same result  two of them then went with mr  home into another room where there was a heavy mahogany loo table on a pillar and claw  and immediately they placed their hands on it  it tilted from one side to the other  and when mr  home was sitting some three feet away from it  it moved about two feet in the opposite direction to that in which mr  home was sitting  the table be  came very light and very heavy by turns  and oscillated violently without shaking off a small statuette standing under a glass shade in the centre of it  the chairs also moved  and the room appeared to shake  whilst raps were heard on the walls  the windows  and on the table itself  lieturning to the other room  the whole party sat again round the table  and an accordion of mr  jones s  which had been previously inspected by the sceptics  was observed to rock upon the table  and mr  home  having asked whether the spirits wished to play upon it  and being answered in the affirmative  he held the accordion at arm s length by the lower end of it  that is  not the key end  under the table  one of the sceptics moving his seat so that he could observe the movements of the accordion  the accordion then com  menced playing  and the   blue bells of scotland   being mentioned by mr  bremner  a bar or two of that air was played  then mr  jones asked for some echoes  and a series of echoes proceeded from the accordion with remarkable precision and a very beautiful effect  some louder strains then proceeded from the accordion  and mr  home held the accordion close to the feet of the writer hereof  so that he could feel the keys moving up and down against his feet  mr  ward was asked to look under the table  he did so  and saw the accordion playing mk home only holding it by the reverse end  and with one hand  his other hand being upon the table  the accordion then ceased playing  and repeated raps being heard  the alphabet was called over  and the following words spelt out  c we regret that we can do no more    we do not intend to enter upon any speculations as to the cause of the manifestations we have related  we are not believers in spiritualism  although we confess ourselves totally unable to discover the cause  or the motive power of what we here relate  mr  home was at times sitting away from the table when raps were heard and movements felt  the accordion he certainly only held by one hand  we were allowed to watch him as closely as we pleased  he did not fix his attention upon any of us  or we might have imagined ourselves under mesmeric influence  we were permitted to examine the furniture  to move it about  to make any remarks  and to ask any questions we pleased  we were perfectly sober  some tea and coffee had been served out the writer partook of none  and we are as we have said  utterly unable to say from what cause or by what power the various incidents occurred  we can only say that they certainly hap  pened very nearly as we have recorded them  and we have to thank mr  jones and mr  home for their courtesy towards us  we went to mr  jones s house disbe  lieving his statements of fact  we saw phenomena which were sufficient to show us that all he has related pould occur by the same power  whatever that power may be   why galileo was persecuted  in the days of old  men who taught unpopular scientific truths received proper attention at the hands of the holy inquisition  in these days things are not so bad  because of the backward state of education in england  the public and the newspapers begin by ridi  culing and abusing unpopular facts  but when they find the facts too strong for them  it is possible to raise the cry of   investigate   investigate    which cry ought to be raised at the outset  the reason why galileo was imprisoned  and threatened with  if he did not actually receive  the torture  is shown in the official condemnation giving the following dogmatical declara  tion of the cardinals     that the sun is the centre of the world  and immoevable in respect of local motion  is an absurd proposition  false in philosophy  and formally heretical  seeing it is expressly contrary to holy scrip  ture  that the earth is not the centre of the world  nor immoveable  but moves even with a diurnal motion  is also an absurd proposition  false in philosophy  and  considered theologically  is at least an error in faith   for these heretical  absurd propositions  galileo was condemned to the prison of the holy inquisition  and enjoined  under the title of salutary penitence  that during three years he was to recite once a week the seven penitential psalms  at seventy years of age he was compelled on his knees to abjure and recant the false dogma  that the sun is the centre of the motion of the world  and immoveable  and that the earth is not the centre  and moves  of iutetmgs  st  john s association of spiritualists  on thursday  november 4th  a lecture on spiritualism was delivered in connection with the st  john s association of spiritualists  at the st  john s temperance hall  7  corpora  tion row  clerkenwell  by mr  john jones  of enmore park  south norwood  mr  jones is a retired city merchant  and a well known friend of spiritualism  the admission was free  and the room was completely filled with an audience who listened to the lecturer with respectful attention through  out  the lecture was illustrated by a series of dissolving views  painted and thrown on the screen by mr  henry biel  field  mr  jones said that his lecture was probably but the first of a series of the same description  which it is intended to deliver in all parts of london during the coming winter  at one time the public when speaking of a spiritualist would tap their foreheads with the finger  and say    ah   poor fellow 1 there s something wrong here     now  all that feeling is dying out  and one of deep and absorbing interest in spiritualism is taking its place  many now wish to under  stand it  which it is not so easy to do   the supernatural can  not be understood because it is so high above our own powers of mind and body  on the preceding evening he had been present at a meeting of the dialectical society a body of materialists  who look upon themselves as something like grasshoppers  having a brief existence here  and then going off somewhere  they are not sure where  but they believe neither in devils nor in angels  in a reply which he  mr  jones  read on the preceding evening at the dialectical society  in answer to some attacks on spiritualism  he ven  tured to give definitions of his opinion of the natural and supernatural  in one sense there is nothing super  natural  for all universal nature seen or unseen is natural  whether organic or inorganic  he stated that there were two classes of intelligent beings in nature  some of them in a body of flesh  and the others outside of it  all movements which man can make  whether physical or chemi  cal  he defined to be natural  all movements which spirits can make by means of the visible or invisible forces of nature which man cannot make  he defined as supematural spiritual ideas are difficult of acceptance to thorough ma  terialists  if one fish told another that there were strange beings in another atmosphere  who did not use fins for loco  motion  but who walked on two legs  other fishes  materialists  would laugh at the statement  in like manner spirits are in a different state to man  and they think and act differently from us  people often say in a conceited way    well  if there are spirits in our midst  why don t they do so and so    ex  pecting beings in a higher state of existence to be at the beck and call of anybody who makes idle suggestions  even though spirits be but human beings out of the flesh  they stand upon a higher plane of existence  to go into some of the details of the subject  he would state that there are essences or forces emanating from all substances  which pro  duce effects on matter visible to the eye  he might  for illustration  quote the fact that if a plate of bright easily oxidisable metal was suspended for a moderate length of time over a manure heap  its surface would become tar  nished by the simple chemical  action of the gases emanat  ing below  but there are also emanations of a more subtle nature from all substances  god had given him  mr  jones  thirteen children  five of whom are now alive  and as he was a man who never sought publicity or public honours of any description  his delight had always been to spend his evenings with his children at home trying experiments of a somewhat strange nature  he had thus found out many curious facts as to the action of the emanations from shells and minerals upon clairvoyant sensitives  and when he first heard of spiritualism he came to  the conclusion that it was all caused by the action upon clairvoyants of the forces emanating from surrounding material objects  but the sight of a few of the simplest of the phenomena of spiritualism soon convinced him of his error  his experiments with shells and minerals were conducted in a room absolutely and perfectly dark  one of his best clair  voyant patients was a lady  and in her presence he one by one took some english and foreign shells out of the paper in which they were wrapped  and placed them on the top of the piano  the sensitive  who saw luminous emanations from the shells  would say of one shell    that s blue   and of another    that s pink   from some she saw long lambent flames and smoke arising  which sometimes reached as high as the ceil  ing   some shells looked dark like pewter  and had a painful influence upon the clairvoyant  after being in the dark room some time she said she could see him and everything in it quite distinctly  his hearers might say    how did he know that he was not duped by the girl    well  he tested that by means of a fresh lot of perhaps two dozen shells  bringing each of them for a short time within range of her eyes in the dark room  and then taking it into the light  and writing down what she said about each shell  the clairvoyant never saw them in the light at all  he then placed them on the top of the piano  and told the clairvoyant to write out in the pitch dark room a description of the emanations from each shell  and place the description on the shell itself  this was done  and when lights were admitted he found that the two descriptions of each shell agreed exactly  in every case but one  lately he had been regretting that he did not think at the time to break up that one shell  and give her the pieces to examine separately  to see whether there was much difference in the emanations from the different parts  the aura from the shells is disturbed by the motion of the air  and sensitives are sometimes made very ill by shells containing traces of putrefying matter  the lecturer then spoke of the aura from magnets  as seen in the experiments of reichenbach and others  and pointed out how iron filings or taranaki iron sand may be sifted over a table  and the particles made to arrange themselves in the lines of magnetic force  when a magnet is placed at some little distance beneath  here  then  is an invisible force proceeding right through a wooden table  and moving solid matter on the other side    give a spirit the necessary conditions  and it can also throw invisible power to make solid objects move  a mesmeric aura  seen by sensi  tives  proceeds from every human being  and influences the actions of people more than most of them are aware  as combustion of the elements of food goes on in the body  this aura is thrown out  and by the exercise of the will power it can be sent in any desired direction  this aura often has health giving properties  so that certain individuals have the power to a large extent of curing the sick by mesmeric influ  ence  many may doubt the reality of these emanations because they themselves cannot see them  still that is no proof that they do not exist  sunlight is built up of many colours  which nobody can see in the light itself  but the philospher takes his prism  disentangles the mixed rays in white light  and spreads them out in all the beautiful colours of the rainbow  by invisible forces then  the spirits  when the necessary conditions are supplied them  can act upon solid matter  he had seen an accordion belonging to himself  with no hidden machinery inside  which  when held in only one of the hands of mr  home  the medium  produced the most ex  quisite music  the accordion is so much used by spirits  because no tricks of man can possibly get music out of it under these conditions  the spirits give different tunes  grave or gay  according to the humour of the circle at the time  and when in a serious mood they will sometimes give music of the most exquisite and ethereal beauty  now swelling out with a grand roll as if from a great organ  and gradually dying away  such music no man could bring out of the same instrument  a voice did the accordion move  sir   mr  jones yes  it expanded and contracted  he con  tinued by saying that he had seen it sometimes travel round the room playing in the air  touched by no visible person  and this too in the presence of from eight to twelve witnesses  he had seen a table go up to the ceiling in the presence of seven individuals  holding distinguished positions in life  and one of them wrote about it in the cornhill magazine  in an article headed   stranger than fiction   friends of his  whose statements he could perfectly trust  had seen three tables floating round the room at the same time  but he had not seen this himself  sometimes the spirits controlled the hand of a person of a writing medium and while he was talking with those around him  would make him write out intelligent messages  sometimes with as much velocity as if his arm were driven by a steam engine  a voice i suppose you want us to believe all this 1 mr  jones calling attention to a very pretty picture of a chrysalis  caterpillar  and butterfly  upon the screen  said that it was a picture of a natural resurrection  and asked if they had never seen the insect except in this condition  the cater  pillar   would they ever believe it would come to that  point  ing to the butterfly   very beautiful invisible phenomena are diffused everywhere in nature  the rose and the flowers of the garden throw off their invisible fragrance  and where there is fragrance there must be substance  to spirits  who see the aura thrown off by flowers  a garden glows with all the varied hues of the rainbow  [at this point another pic  ture was thrown upon the screen  representing the spirit leav  ing the head of a dying woman  and angels receiving the newly born spirit]  here  said mr  jones  is the spiritual resurrection  here is the thing called death  i know some  thing of death  for i have lost eight children  and have also sat by the dying bed of brothers and sisters  once i sat at such scenes weeping and wailing  but now i no longer grieve so deeply  and sorrow only because they are leaving me alone in my old age  though going from me to a land of beauty  light  and love  mr  jones continued that the next picture represented an angel pointing out to st  john the beauties the new jerusalem  and he had had the picture introduced because he was one of those who believed in the old and new testaments  they would remember that when the angel gave st  john the revelation  the latter fell down on his knees to worship  but the angel said to him    i am of thy fellow servants and thy brethren the prophets   an angel  then  is only a spiritualised prophet  the very best text book of spiritualism is the bible   applause   nearly all the phenomena seen at the present day in spiritual circles  are clearly described in the bible  though in those days there may have been greater power at work  still spiritualism is spreading in england far and wide  the literature of eng  land is saturated with spiritualism  for very many of the writers are well up in the subject  though most of them do not wish it to be known  it has even forced its way among the scientific journals  and the literature of england works its way all over the world   the lecturer then sat down amid loud applause  and the meeting closed with the usual votes of thanks  summary of the evidence given before the dialectical society  of all the subjects that ever engaged the attention of a learned society  spiritualism has proved to be the strangest  as shown by the evidence given before the dialectical society  and reported in a fragmentary way by most of the daily papers during the present year  portions of the evidence of those witnesses who would allow their statements to be made public were regularly reported in a good east london paper  called the eastern post  some of the witnesses  in consequence of fear of adverse public opinion  or of injury to business reputation  would not let their evidence be reported at all in the public papers  others requested the suppression of their names  but most of them took no shelter of this kind  the following information is abstracted by us for the most part from long reports in the eastern post  extending over the issues of some months  the london dialectical society was established three years ago  to consider   all subjects with a view to the elucidation of truth   taking up questions not ordinarily investigated by other scientific societies  sir john lubbock  bart   f r s   is the president of the society  and among the vice presidents are professor huxley  f r s   lord amberley  mr  g  h  lewes  and miss frances power cobbe  at one of the meet  ings a physician read a paper on some very extraordinary phenomena which he had witnessed himself  and it was stated that the physical and other facts of spiritualism were believed to be real by professor de morgan  president of the mathe  matical society of london   mr  c  f  varley  c e   f r g s   mr  robert chambers  mr  and mrs  s  c  hall  mr  william howitt  and others of like eminence  a somewhat acrimonious debate followed  in which the spiritualists were in a great minority  and a committee of thirty persons was appointed to investigate the phenomena aueged to be spiritual manifesta  tions  and to report thereon   this committee  under the chairmanship of dr  edmunds  comprises members of the legal  medical  and clerical professions  as well as a few engi  neers and architects  and some gentlemen of general scientific and literary attainments  mr  serjeant cox has all along taken a very prominent part in questioning the witnesses  the plan of proceedings is to take the evidence of witnesses  which will be published hereafter in a book   and to witness all the phenomena which can be brought under the notice of the investigators  of the great quantity of testimony already given  the following are a few of the most striking items      practical information about sensitives  who are very numerous in society  and how to perform many of the curious experiments mentioned by mr  jones  will be found in baron yon beichenbach s book on mag   netism  there is a work on the action of sheila and minerals upon sensitives entitled the soul of things  by denton  ed  nov  19  1869  the spiritualist  b mr  h  d  jencken  f r g s   barrister at law   of kilmorey house  penge  deposed that he had often seen the levitations of mr  home s body  he had seen mr  home s body rise in the air  and pass out of one open window and into another at ashley house  near the victoria railway station  and he had seen him gliding in the air  several feet above the ground  at adare manor  he had often heard the raps  and seen tables suspended in the air without visible means of sup  port  and once  at the house of dr  gully  at great malvern  he had seen an accordion suspended in space  and played by invisible agencies  the music being accompanied by three spirit voices chanting a hymn  he also deposed that he had seen lord adare hold in his bare hand  without pain  a burn  ing live coal which mr  home had placed there  and which burnt the hands of other persons who only touched it momen  tarily  he had likewise seen a burning coal similarly placed on the top of the head of mr  s  c  hall  f s a   barrister  at law  without any injury resulting  he had seen mr  home place his head in the flames of the grate  and seen the flames playing between the locks of mr  home s hair  but no injury or pain resulted  he had seen the elongation and the con  traction both of the body of mr  home and miss bertolacci  he had also often seen spirit hands and forms at circles  many witnesses besides himself had seen these things at the same time  the rev  j  mttkray spear  of 14  ampthill square  hamp  stead road  ist w   deposed that he was an american  and had no belief in spiritualism  till one day he found his hand moved as a writing medium  the first message was   we wish you to go to abingdon to see david binning   he knew no such person  but made inquiries for david binning at abingdon  u s   and found him very ill with neuralgia  instantly some  thing passed from his  mr  spear s  hand to mr  binning  the latter felt a shock or two  then all pain ceased  and he was cured  these facts he considered proved intelligence and benevolence on the part of the unseen power  mr  spear nar  rated also other incidents  mr  e  l  blanchard  the well known author  deposed that he went to marshalls   the paid mediums  for the express purpose of showing them up in the newspapers  the mani  festations he saw there compelled him to know that they came from spirits  he had seen a small spark appear on the floor  and gradually grow into a hand  which had power to lift up a handkerchief when thrown upon it  he had been uplifted by the spirits himself  and kept for some time in the air  but for some years past he had refused to let them use him as a medium  as it was inconvenient to be interfered with by them when printers were waiting for   copy   mr  j  jones  of enmore park  south norwood  deposed  that when in mr  home s presence he had seen a chair floating through the air  and had seen his own mother  an aged lady  raised off the ground  chair and all  by invisible agencies  these things all occurred in the presence of many witnesses  apart from the physical manifestations  the communications made by the spirits were of a high order of intelligence and benevolence  and had done much good in his family  mr  c  f  varley  c e   f r g s   the electrician  deposed that the first spiritual message he ever received told him that on a certain day  hour  and minute  an ulcer would break in the throat of a lady relative  and that if he made certain pre  parations there was a chance that she would survive the trial  everything took place as predicted  as he did not know beforehand that the ulcer would break then  and as the lady did not know it  and was not told of the message till the danger was over  he believed that his communicants told the truth when they said they were spirits  he also narrated how a spirit gave the same message to himself at beckenham  and to a gentleman at birmingham on the same night  neither of them expecting any such message  or anticipating the con  tents  the forces called electricity and magnetism by spiri  tualists are not electricity  and are not magnetism  he said that all who give evidence on spiritualism should always doubt the accuracy of the observing instrument  namely   themselves   and chiefly select cases in which their testi  mony can be amply supported by other witnesses of the same facts f   mrs  honeywood said that at one of her sittings  at which mr  home was the medium  the table rose  and the room vibrated so violently that an engineer present said that nothing but the strongest machinery would cause such oscilla  tion  an accordion was played in the air  mr  home holding one strap  three or four persons mentally wished for par  ticular tunes  unknown to mr  home  and they were played  the hon  mrs  egehton deposed the most remarkable manifestations i have seen were those of last sunday evening at my house  we were seated in a room which would have been dark but for the light outside  we first heard raps  and then we saw a figure at the window  it entered  and then figures came trooping in by dozens  one waved its hand and passed through us the atmosphere became fearfully cold  a figure that of a relative passed behind my chair  leaned over  and brushed my hair lightly with its hand  it was eight feet high  and approaching the person of lindsay  passed through him  he sobbed hysterically from the intense cold  but the most extraordinary thing of all was  the laughter  one of us said something  and all the spirits laughed with joy  the sound was indescribably strange  and it appeared to us as if it came from the ground  we were seven in number  five of the seven saw just what i have described  and the others saw something  but not so distinctly  mr  home said there were nineteen spirits in the room at one time  and i could see their eyes ^peculiarly brilliant eyes looking at us  mr  home said to me    don t be frightened  there is a spirit coming to you 1   and in a few moments i saw the bright eyes of the spirit looking at me  the figure was defined  there were no clothes  but there was a peculiar rustle like that of silk  the faces were not defined to my view  but mr  home said he could see them  they had bare faces  mr  home was in the trance state  walking about the room  i did not sleep much that night  for the spirits followed me to my room  mr  home had no previous access to the room where the stance took place beyond having dined there  mr  daniel d  home  in the course of his deposition  said that once his body was elongated about eight inches  when lord adare had hold of his head  and the master of lindsay had hold of his feet  he had seen a pencil lifted by a spirit hand write on paper in the presence of the emperor napoleon  this took place in a large room  the salon louis quinze  the empress was also present  the hand  after writing  went to the emperor  who kissed it  it then went to the empress  she withdrew from the touch  and the hand followed her  the   the english gentleman who was recently nearly murdered by a mob in spain  as reported in the times  t a burlesque of the weakest part of mr  yarley s evidence was published in the echo newspaper  in the report he was made to speak in the first person words which he never uttered  and the few paragraphs forming the burlesque were printed as if they constituted the whole of his evidence before the dialectical society  which occupied more than an hour in delivery  emperor said   do not be frightened  kiss it   she then kissed it  and it shortly afterwards disappeared  the writing was an autograph of the emperor napoleon i  the emperor of russia has also seen and handled spirit hands  which after  wards seemed to melt away into thin air  mrs  cox  of cox s hotel  jermyn street  said that she had seen mr  home  as well as furniture  floating in the air  and that the spirits had cured her of an ailment  something the matter with her side  of many years  standing  the countess de pomar said that she had witnessed the handling of red hot coals with bare fingers without pain resulting  signor damiani  a sicilian gentleman  residing at clifton  bristol  said that at mrs  mary marshall s  who did not know him  a spirit had communicated with him  professing to be his sister  he replied that he had never had a sister of that name  the spirit answered that he was mistaken  accordingly  he wrote to his mother  then in sicily  and learnt that a sister of that name had died in infancy  the spirits  he said  are good  bad  and indifferent  as upon earth  and some of them are ragamuffins  the master of lindsay  grosvenor square  deposed that he had seen mr  home elongated  that he had seen him float  ing through the air  and that he had seen him float out of the window at ashley house  as narrated by mr  jencken  he had also  while in bed in the same room with mr  home  seen the spirit of mr  home s wife in a long  flowing gown  which hung without belt from the shoulders  the figure appeared quite solid  and not at all transparent  mr  b  coleman  bemard villas  upper norwood  said that some years ago  soon after he had arrived in new york  he called upon miss kate fox  the celebrated american medium  and expressed his curiosity to learn something of this latest and most remarkable phase of spiritualism  while seated by her side on the sofa three loud raps were heard on the table  which was in the centre of the room   apparently in answer to some jocular remark he had made   it seems we have listeners here   he said  the three raps were repeated  it may be remarked  for the sake of the uninitiated  that in the spiritualistic system of telegraphy three raps are generally understood to imply an affirmative    shall we come to the table 1   three raps    is there any spirit here waiting to communicate with me   three raps again   will you tell me your name   he asked  the answer was spelt out by means of an alphabet    your stepson harry    the medium could scarcely have known the fact of his having a stepson of that name  for he was an entire stranger in the city     how happy i am to be able once more to converse with you   here there appeared to be a break in the sentence  for the table proceeded to rap out the words   let me speak   and miss fox suggested that it was perhaps another spirit who desired to speak to him  the table rapped assent    is there another spirit present  then  who wishes to communicate with me    i then asked   yes    are you a friend of mine    yes     a relative       yes     your name       annie   mr  coleman assured the committee that he had been unable at the moment to recollect any one in his family of that name  and that he had accordingly denied stoutly that he had any such relative  the words were then spelt out   0 how your voice recaus the memory of the past  how rejoiced i am to be able to thank you for your kindness to my daughter eliza   it was his wife s mother who had   passed away   twenty five years ago  he also mentioned a rather remarkable fact that had occurred while he was staying at malvern  he had been conversing on spiritualism with the family at whose house he was lodging  and had afterwards gone out to see a friend in the neighbourhood  on his return he was proceeding straight  way to bed  when the master of the house came rushing into his room  and asked him  for heaven s sake  to come down stairs immediately  he accordingly went  and upon entering the drawing room a strange sight met his gaze  miss   a young lady who was staying in the house  was lying on the sofa in violent hysterics  mrs   appeared overwhelmed with terror  and a small tripod table was dancing frantically up and down the room  as if delighted beyond measure at the consternation it had created  on mr  coleman s entrance the table ambled towards the door  made a low bow to him  and then proceeded to execute a series of terpsichorean extrava  gances of a most curious and remarkable description  he then strove to calm the young lady  she was just beginning to re  cover when the table came bobbing towards her in a most extraordinary manner  and sent her off again  mr  coleman then went to the table  and placing his hand upon it  said    we  have had enough of this nonsense  in god s name  go    when the movements instantly ceased  upon explanation  it appeared that during hisabsence  trey thought they would try for themselves whether there was any truth in spiritualism or not  a circle was formed  consisting of the father  mother  and daughter  her friend miss   and a bluff  incredulous yorkshireman  the most surprising results were obtained    it was the most extraordinary thing i ever saw   said the yorkshireman afterwards to me   that table talked to me  and told me of my father and mother for all the world like a human   [sic]  at another sea nee at which mr  coleman had been present with mr  d  d  home  the table rose right up to the ceiling  he all the time holding mr  home s hands firmly in his own  this  too  was in a private house  where all the persons in the circle were friends of his own  and incapable of trickery or imposture  he had also seen  while sitting with the same circle  a beautiful hand and arm  which he was cer  tain could not have belonged to any one present  appear above the table and ring a bell  the same hand was afterwards placed in his hand  mr  serjeant cox remarked that he had heard of women who could make people believe they were tormented by a wasp  that they could smell flowers  and so on  by the mere exercise of their will  he desired to ask mr  coleman how he could be certain he was not biologised at the time  and merely imagining these things  mr  coleman said biology might explain some of the phenomena  but there were others that it could not possibly account for such  for instance  as spirit drawings  he had been present at the production of several elaborate crayon drawings in spaces of time varying from seven to ten seconds  he had himself previously marked the paper so as to enable him with certainty to identify it  these drawings were still in his possession  and he would be glad to exhibit them to the committee  the modus operandi for the production of these spirit drawings was very remarkable  clean pieces of paper  with crayons  were placed in a covered box  a rapid scratching of the paper was then heard  and in a few seconds the crayons were heard to fall  and the drawing was ready for inspection  he would like to know how biology could account for this  mr  borthwick said that without desiring to propound any theory with regard to the phenomena  he could certainly substantiate the statement of mr  coleman with regard to spirit drawings  the blank paper was marked by thosev present and placed under a shawl which had been tied round the table  a scratching noise was then heard  and in from seven to nine seconds the drawing was completed  m  chevalier expressed his belief that the manifestations were diabolical  and said that one spirit had candidly acknow  ledged to him that he was the devil  the manifestations at his house always stopped at the name of the trinity  the countess adelina de pomar then made a few re  marks to the effect that it was very narrow minded and wrong to drive away as diabolical those poor spirits who chanced not to believe in the trinity  miss houghton  of 20  delamere crescent  westboume  square  w   deposed that for years she had refused to com  municate with any spirits but those who confessed their belief in the trinity  and joined with the members of the circle in prayer  the manifestations did not stop at the name of the trinity  and her spirit friends were good ones  miss anna blackwell of the avenue d eylau  paris deposed that at her seances they always began with prayer  once at mr  s  c  hall s the spirits said    now  pay attention  and we will show yon how we form things out of the air   they watched  and presently they saw the air become thick  fog  like  in one spot  and then it became solidified into cloth  that cloth was passed around  examined  pulled  and was seen to be such a piece of doth as might be sewn on a trowsers  it was then put down   and gradually melted away into the air  mr  percival  an officer in the guards  narrated several instances in which  after prayer  he had seen some of the future events of his life pass before his eyes  and that these visions  together with the persons represented in them  were afterwards met with in reality  mr  hain friswell  author  deposed that he had seen the manifestations in mrs  marshall s presence in his own house  he knew they were real  and the ladies of his family had even searched mrs  marshall  clothes and all  thoroughly  raps and table movings had also been obtained by the mem  bers of his own family without the presence of a professional medium  he regarded it all as the work of the devil  a great many other persons  also deposed that they had seen certain remarkable manifestations  at one of the meetings of the society  when fifty or sixty ladies and gentlemen were present  including the reporters of several london news  papers  mrs  mary marshall  the medium  of 2  bennett street  st  james s  w   attended  a public sea nce was the result  the mental tests were failures in all cases but one  when a name asked for and unknown to the medium was signalled out  the physical manifestations were successful  as the table bounced about the room  and got up on a sofa  without anybody being able to detect trickery  baps also came upon one of the folding doors  at a distance from the medium  in a good light  with plenty of witnesses looking on  the pro  ceedings were fully reported in the badly telegraph next morning  the other practical investigations made by the dialetical society have been conducted in private  and have not yet been published  the inquiry into this subject will be continued during the winter months  the anthropological society  on the evening of tuesday  november 2nd  the first meeting of the present session of the anthropological society was held at 4  st  imartin s place  trafalgar square  mr  hermann beigel  m d   h r c p   in the chair  mr  l  0  pike  m a   read a long paper upon   methodical anthropological re  search   in the course of which he made a casual remark about the psychological branch of the subject  after a few remarks from mr  braybrook and mr  j  gould avery  mr  john jones said that the society ought to give more study to psychology  and he had often said so to various mem  bers of the society  although his suggestion was generally   pooh poohed   psychology  he said  is to a considerable ex  tent an index to race  for local superstitions prevalent in par  ticular districts in the united kingdom can often be traced to their sources  slavonic superstitions exist in our midst  although often no tradition or historical connection can be traced in the same direction  he should like to have permis  sion to bring this subject more prominently before the society on a future occasion  dr  carter blake  after a few remarks on the study of skulls  said that the society was in a state of the most profound and entire ignorance about the alleged psychological forces  major s  r  j  owen  f l s   said that the society in its researches might investigate many things  some of which he was almuat afraid to name the davenport brothers  for instance   their manifestations might be all   humbug   he would not say they were not still  he thought the subject a fair one for investigation  ^ mr  w  dendy sug  gested that as many 0f the members seemed afraid to talk about spiritual things  of psychology  they should coin some new word to represent the science of the miu^  after some remarks by mr  mackenzie and the rev  dunbar heath  mr  t  bendyshe  m  a   of cambridge university  calledx attention to an article in the north british beview ok  the early history of man   which he said well de  served consideration by the members of the society  eh also recommended the perusal of a book on   the origin of religion and its developments   by the rev  baring gould  a minister of the church of england  mr  l  o  pike said that the word  psyche  in the original greek meant both   the soul   and   the breath   wherefore it may be logically used by those who do not wish to be under  stood to be speaking of   the soul   leaving also no necessity for the coining of  aj new word  as mr  dendy had suggested  dr  beigel  in conclusion  said a few respectful words on the great loss sustained by the society in the death of its founder  dr  james hunt  and added that he would have spoken further on the subject were it not that it would be brought before a future meeting of the society by the presi  dent  the proceedings then closed  a spirit on   ghosts   the editor of an old estab  lished scientific periodical recently attended the   voice   circle at the house of the non professional medium   mr  e  childs  21  offord street  caledoniam road  n  the visitor  who had previously thoroughly tested the genuine character   f  of the manifestations  remarked that he should not feel in the slightest degree nervous if any or all of the spirits there present made themselves visible to him at any time  a spirit calling himself   alonzo bates    replied   what 1 not if i suddenly appeared before you in a white sheet on a dark night    no   said the editor   but surely you would not be so foolish as to put on a white sheet       certainly not   replied the spirit    but you know that such is the orthodox ghost of the servant girls    the pressure on the part of the public for admission to mr  child s stances is now very great  4 the spiritualist  nov  19  1869  spirit greetings  some very interesting spirit   communications from swedenborg and lord bacon were received in the course of the years 1853 and 1854  at judge edmonds  circle in new york  these communications were after  wards published in a work on spiritualism  in two volumes  by judge edmonds  mr  g   t  dexter  m d   and the  governor of wisconsin  the messages de  scribed much of the life and habits of the spirits in the condition of life incidental to the two spirits who com  municated  and the opening greetings of the spirits every evening before the real work began were of a very pleasing nature  on the evening of may 1  1853  swedenborg said     with feelings of affection and love to you all  and with my spirit gushing forth with joy for the opportu  nities i enjoy in communicating with you  i again most sincerely greet you in god s most holy name   on april 24  1853  he said      in our circle  where  the spirits of those we love most do congregate  are gathered together once more  weekly  this number  and we celebrate what to us is the sabbath day  it is indeed a beautiful thought to you  dear friends  that we live and act almost as you do  that we cherish a thousand associations which on earth were most dear  with all my feelings alive to the affectionate remembrances of life with my friends  and eternity with my spirit companions too  i this night greet you cordially  heartily  and truthfully  in the name of our heavenly father   on may 8  1853  he said     the night is dark and stormy  and the air should be chill and uncomfortable  you draw near your fire  sides and sit conversing with one another  and opening your hearts to the genial influence of social connections  with us  we do not feel the effects of storm or cold when approaching your earth  and our spirits are not clothed   with such garments as hide the true purposes of our hearts  we converse with one another  but our mean  ing is perceived without the expression of thought  and the farther we progress the more is our spirit manifest through all the developments of its covering  but to  night  in spite of rain and chill  i meet warm hearts and strong desires to excel  and i give you a response founded on the very basis of our creation a response of love and truth  and greet you in the name of god   on may 19  1853  he said     there are to night with me many spirits of your friends  who have met accidentally  but who delegate me to say that their affection surrounds you  and their love is a part of your existence  as through it you may receive many impressions for good  and by it you are supported to endure many of the troubles and ills of life  cordially  heartily  and affectionately they  with me  greet you to night   on may 22  1853  he said      while we are listening to thoughts from the spirit  land  and wonder at the developments made of what have been mysteries  have we  when our hearts have been filled with joy at the description of the beautiful abodes of the just  and the happiness diffused like air through all the higher spheres of the spirits  dwelling  place  have we ever asked ourselves the question  for what purpose are these teachings   why have spirits left their homes  their pursuits  their affections  their upward flight towards the ultimate point of their exist  ence   why have they come to us  and why have they taught us the higher truths of spirit revelation   why have they selected us as the recipients of spirit bounty     is it not that your own natures should be made to correspond with the pure and holy existences of those good spirits whose habits  life  and progress we have de  scribed   is it not that you should struggle to elevate n ^wir own internal natures  and divest yourselves of those characteristics which mark you as still bound in the fetters of error       how hard have you struggled   how much have   you succeeded  and how long will it be before you shall have cast off all that cloaks your true feelings  and manifest the true condition and action of your life   how long will you battle with causes which you suffer to influence you  and not purge yourselves of all un  righteousness     these are grave and important inquiries  which should be put to every heart  and earnestly too  sincerely too  in the spirit of truth  of love  and of strong desire to answer truly the responses of our own hearts  before our friends who know and the god who made us    in a spirit  to night  of affection that brings you near my soul  and with a love that brings me to you for the high object of doing you good  do i greet you in the name of god   on june 16  1853  swedenborg said     my friends  could you but know the great joy there is among us  could you see the unspeakable happiness which animates every countenance at the spread of the glorious truths which are being revealed to man  and could you know the deep earnest faith we have in those selected to give to the world the first revelations of the higher spirits to man  you would then realise the emo  tions of spirit in the spheres  the emotion of unmixed love     at the dawning of truth  our blessings with each and all    general the  spibitualist  the first number of this journal has to meet a demand which at the present time is to large extent unknown  but it is believed that a supply considerably in excess of the probable sale  has been printed  at the same time  as new journals of this kind  connected with a growing movement  often run out of print before the demand ceases  subscribers who wish to preserve copies for binding  had either better keep those they receive in the first instance  or let orders for additional copies reach the publisher by wednesday next  up to that day this number will be still in type  so that more copies can be printed if they are likely to be wanted  stiff covers  with elastic strings at the back  to hold for reference many copies of the spiritualist  and to keep them clean till required for binding  may be obtained of mr  h  k  judd  bookbinder  15  little new street  earring  don street  e c   at various prices  the dialectical societt  a summary of the past pro  ceedings of the dialectical society is printed on another page  and their future meetings will be regularly reported in this journal  the evidence already given necessarily relates mostly to physical manifestations  since these  when proved to be facts  are beyond the reach of fancy  and cannot be con  sidered as obscure psychological phenomena incidental to human beings in an abnormal state  still  non spiritualists should understand that physical phenomena at circles are usually followed  or accompanied  by spirit communications  after the production in our presence of some of the wonderful phenomena incidental to mr  home s mediumship  the spirits once gave an address to the effect that they only gave the manifestations to demonstrate that a real  practical  and intel  ligent power was at work  these high class spirits disclaimed the possession of miraculous powers  and said that they were able to produce the effects simply because they have learnt more of the laws of nature than we have  sometimes they fail when they attempt to give manifestations  the gower steeet conference  in november  1868  a conference of london spiritualists began to be held weekly at lawson s rooms  gower street  close to the metropolitan railway station  non spiritualists also attended largely   the meetings were of an interesting character  so much so that on nearly every evening many persons could only find stand  ing room  these meetings lasted till the summer of 1869  the addresses of mrs  emma hardinge  the logical inspira  tional speaker  being a great attraction  at present it is un  decided when the meetings shall begin again  but the secre  tary has enough surplus cash in hand from last season to clear the expenses incidental to the next five meetings  the committee of management consists of mr  luxmoore  pre  sident   mr  and mrs  everitt  mrs  hardinge  mr  t  shorter  mrs  floyd  mrs  wilkinson  and mr  t  slater  spiritualism in new zealand  mr  w  d  meers  medium  in a letter dated dunedin  new zealand  sept  2  1869  written to mr  and mrs  everett  of penton street  pen  tonville  gives some information about spiritualism in his neighbourhood  he says that before his arrival there had been much talk about spiritualism  and the periodicals on the subject had been very generally read  but few persons had tried any practical experiments  his seances contributed to give fresh impetus to the subject  and the result was that one of the ministers in dunedin gave a lecture on spiritualism  beginning by saying that it was all animal magnetism  and ending by saying that it was all the work of the devil  he did not deny the facts  for he admitted he had been to one siance himself  and had had his test questions about departed friends correctly answered a result which he ascribed to thought reading  somehow the devil theory people are almost always persons who have been only to three or four stances  or who have investigated only a week or a month  and then rushed before the public with their very valuable aiid deep experience  the result of the lecture was a newspaper war  and as the editors gave fair play to both parties  the spiritualists  supported by hard well attested facts  neces  sarily came off best  mr  meers is a very good seeing medium  and is able to describe accurately the appearance and dresses of the spirit friends of persons present at his circles  he also sees them at work while they are producing the physical manifestations which are obvious to the senses of others  spiritualism in east london  an east london asso  ciation of spiritualists was formed a year or two_ago  and now has a large number of spirit ciroles at work  easy of access to those of the publio wlo really desire to investigate  particulars about the association will be published in an early number of this journal  it is getting difficult to obtain sittings with some of the highly developed media whose seances have been often recorded in the spiritual periodicals  most of these being persons who will not take payment  and who cannot accommodate the large number of people who want to be present  spiritualism in clerkenwell  the st  john s asso  ciation of spiritualists was formed in may last  and at start  ing had twenty seven members  but the number has since increased to forty  a great many strangers from all parts of london attend its meetings at intervals  the members sub  scribe  when necessary  enough to clear the expenses of the room  gas  and advertising  seances are held every thursday evening at st  john s temperance hall  7  corporation row  clerkenwell  when from forty to sixty persons are usually in attendance  the mediums are mr  davis and mr  woolnough  who obtain trance manifestations  and a few of the physical description also  mr  herne and mr  morse are sometimes in attendance  during the winter it is the intention of the society to have lectures or social meetings monthly  strangers are admitted by tickets  obtainable of mr  steele  36  great sutton street  clerkenwell  at one time anybody was ad  mitted without a ticket  but the present arrangement became necessary because sometimes roughs attended for the express purpose of making a disturbance  the hon  secretary is mr  r  pearce  34  halliford street  downham road  n  spiritualism in bloomsbury  every friday evening  a semi public seance is held at the spiritual library  15 south  ampton row  high holborri  w c  admission is by introduc  tion  which may very easily be obtained by any stranger really desirous to investigate   also  a fee of one shilling each person is charged  the medium is mr  morse  who does not obtain physical manifestations  therefore this circle is not the best for a notice to attend   but many of the communications received through the mediumship of mr  morse are of a highly mental character  the stances begin at eight o clock  after which hour the doors are closed against all comers  to prevent the annoyance of interruptions caused in many circles by the entrance of those who are not punctual  there are many spiritualists  and persons interested in spiritualism  living in the neighbourhood of kingsland and dalston  the result is likely to be the early formation of a local society in that district  spiritualists are numerous in the picturesque district surrounding the crystal palace  there are also many at kingston upon tbames  mesmerism and clairvoyance  dr  sheldon chadwick is now giving a course of four lectures on mesmerism and clair  voyance  at the british schools  stoke newington  three out of the four have been delivered  and the last one will be given next wednesday evening  at eight o clock  one of the most curious of the experiments is one wherein miss montague  a pretty little girl about thirteen years of age  is seated by her  self in the middle of a large platform  with her eyes bound with a handkerchief  the lecturer then wtalks about among the audience  and the name of anything which those present choose to take out of their pockets and show the  lecturer is spoken by the little girl  it is a common conjuring trick to get in this way the names of ordinary articles of dress and of figures  by wording the questions according to preconcerted arrangement  and having a sharp grown up blindfolded col  league on the platform to catch the signals and give the replies  to dr  chadwick  however  nothing came amiss  whether the articles were purses  babies  shoes  red tape  lockets  or the proper names inside the crowns of hats  for instance  on wednesday  november 10  a perfect stranger to dr  chadwick wrote two words  chosen as being difficult to guess  on a piece of paper  and suddenly pushed them into the hands of the lecturer  by whom the action was totally unexpected    what name is this    said the lecturer     carter   said the blindfolded little girl   what is the other name      blake   was the reply    right   said the lecturer  the distance between them was about ten feet  and no other words were exchanged  about 200 witnesses were present  dr  chad  wick stated that the result was obtained by his   willing   very strongly that miss montague should give certain answers  and they always came  in fact  it seemed to be a clear case of trance mediumship  only the patient was influenced by a spirit in the body  instead of a spirit out of the body  he then exhibited some of the usual mesmeric experiments  from fifteen to twenty two persons being influenced each evening  and sometimes more than a dozen of them at the same time  he remarked that too many were influenced  and they had too many friends among the listeners  for the collusion theory to hold good  a single word from the lecturer would make those under his influence exhibit the most violent activity and passions   another word would instantly fix them with all the rigidity of stone  and that  too  in uncomfortable positions  with countenances still and immoveable  the lecturer stated that in the first instance he gave them coins to look at  to withdraw their attention from surrounding objects  and to concentrate it upon one point    then   said he    the various faculties of their mind began to sleep and fold up like the leaves of a flower  and when  with a strong will  i imperiously told them that they could not open their eyes  some of them were unable to do so  i then had the wills of these in my own possession  and the will is the governing power of the whole body  so that i could make them perform many things  but could not influence all of them in the same degree  when i told them to wake up  it meant practically   i give you your will back again   and then they were all right once more   in answer to the theological charge that the curative powers of mesmerism are due to demoniacal agency  he said that it was preposterous to suppose that god sends diseases and the devil cures them  dr  chadwick has lectured before the royal household at windsor castle  charge of imposture  a mr  addison has been writing to the standard  alleging that he  in the presence of some of his friends  had detected mrs  mary marshall doing   spirit  writing   under the table  with a pencil held between her toes  and that he than seized hold of her naked foot  his letters were very rough in their style  and contained insulting remarks about the personal appearance of mrs  marshall s mother in  law  mrs  marshall wrote that his tale was wholly untrue  and narrated instances of his misconduct  mr  addison then   called two of his friends to support his assertions  which they did not do  but they went half way  and said they saw mrs  marshall writing with her foot  one of these witnesses was a comic actor  who spent most of his time at the seance by roll  ing about on the floor  pretending to be in a fit  and frighten  ing the mrs  marshall s considerably  the other witness spent some of his time in drawing a caricature of the elder mrs  marshall  in opposition to the testimony of these highly respectable gentlemen  attention maybe called to the evidence given before the dialectical society  and printed in another column  wherein mr  e  l  blanchard  the author  testifies that his body has been uplifted and held in the air by the spirits at mrs  marshall s seances  mr  hain friswell  author  testifies that table manifestations have taken place in mrs  marshall s presence in his own house  and were obtained after she had been searched  as well as among his own relatives after she had left the premises  the evidence given by signor damiani should also be read  mr  epes sargent  in his book  the planchette  narrates that baron reichenbach attended a circle in london in 1861  at the house of mr  cowper  son in  law of lord palmerston  the media present were the two mrs  marshall s  violent physical manifestations were ob  served  which the baron was convinced were not caused by imposture  the correspondence in the standard ended with a letter from a philosophical instrument maker  named faulkner  who wrote that he was a manufacturer of goods for spirit rapping people  he having fitted up their houses with wires and concealed electro magnets  to make raps  mr  faulkner has since been asked for references to those whose houses he has so fitted up  and the only reference he gives is to mr  addison  genuine spiritual phenomena go on in any house  which the medium has never entered till the time of the stance  and mrs  mary marshall has for years been in the habit of acepting such out door engagements  charges of the kind mentioned in this paragraph  more or less beset every paid medium  and are among the disagreeable things they have to endure  even when the manifestations are genuine  where the liars go to  an

the literary worh of the spieittjalist  but all letters will meet with careful consideration  the spieittjalist is a periodical intended to give great freedom of expression to all the different shades of opinion to be found among spiritualists  there will therefore be very little uniformity in the ideas promulgated in this journal  more especially in the correspondence columns  under these circumstances every reader will find occasionally something in the spibitualist which he or she does not like  but the right of reply remains  this freedom of thought given to others  the editor claims for himself and those who do not like the contents of leading articles  can write against them in the correspondence columns  this plan is thought belter than that of reducing the contents of the journal to a pale weak mediocrity  by inserting only those contributions which please everybody  the preceding remarks are not intended to imply that those who have crotchets which they cannot get printed anywhere else  can find an outlet for them here  for none but those letters which are considered worth publication will be inserted  notices of public meetings in connection with spiritualism should be sent to the office several days in advance  a large amount of information is printed on the last two pages of this journal  clearly demonstrating that the facts of spiritualism  highly improbable as they appear to be  are real  and deserve serious investigation by all thoughtful people  in other columns of every number of the spiei  tttalist will also be found plenty of additional evidence to the same effect  ca subsmlhrs  the first twelve numbers of the spieittjalist will be forwarded regularly by penny post to subscribers  who remit four shillings in payment  to mr  e  w

monthly  namely  the spiritual magazine  human nature  and daybreak   the spiritual magazine was first published in january  1860  human nature in april  1867  and daybreak in june  1868  the spiritualist  issued for the first time this day  is not started for the purpose of competing with these three journals just mentioned  but is in  tended to occupy new ground  and to meet a want as yet unsupplied  at the gower street conferences last winter  several of the speakers mentioned the want of reports and records of public meetings connected with spiritualism  and one chief object of this new journal is to chronicle the proceedings of such assemblies  another feature of the spieitualist will be  its scientific cha  racter  a third feature  of considerable value to sub  scribers  is seen on pages seven and eight of this number  in the shape of a large quantity of well authenticated evidence that spiritualism deserves most serious investi  gation by all thoughtful people  this evidence  written for the benefit of non spiritualists  will be republished regularly  so that every number of the spiritualist will be an efficient instrument in the hands of friends of the movement to draw the attention of the outside public to spiritualism  at first this journal will be published fortnightly  to   feel the ground   before its transformation into a weekly paper a step which  to  gether with other improvements  is likely to be taken before long  should all go well  much care will be taken to make the spiritualist useful to the pioneers of the greatest movement of modern times  so it is hoped that it will meet with a friendly reception from all engaged in the noble work of strengthening the chain of com  munication between this world and the spirit land  and of clearing away the mystery which ignorance throws over the life beyond the grave  nay  some of those who are as yet unacquainted with the facts of spiritualism are expected to take a little kindly interest in this journal  for their claims to attention have not been forgotten  the scientific investigation of spiritual phenomena  not much observation of the phenomena of spiritualism is necessary to learn that the manifestations are governed by physical and mental laws  though very few of these laws are at present known  systematic  scientific research applied to spiritualism would there  fore  in the course of a few years  be sure to give very valuable results  by clearing away much of the mystery overhanging the border land between this world and the next  and by strengthening the conditions which now enable spirits to communicate  at the present time  while most of the english people are innocently swallowing the highly reliable information about spiritualism given them by the daily papers  and while the orthodox scientific world is standing aloof  afraid to search after truth because of the apparent danger of being caught in the investigation of nonsense  there may still be a sufficient number of persons in the ranks of spiritualism competent to begin the work of reducing its facts to a science  in general society the proportion of people experienced in experimental natural philoso  phy and mental science is very small  partly because these subjects are generally neglected in schools and universities  and partly because everybody has not a liking for such pursuits  probably the necessary mate  rials may now be found within the ranks of spiritualism to found a scientific society  but if not  the work need not be altogether neglected  supposing a scientific society were formed  its first work must be to collect a large mass of authenticated facts  and then try to extricate some few general prin  ciples from the tangled mass  anonymous articles in periodicals cannot be accepted as good evidence  neither can facts long stored up in the memory of witnesses be accepted as free from error  but this necessary work of collecting authenticated facts might as well be begun at once  with or without the formation of a scientific society  perhaps the best way to begin would be to arrange with different circles  to write down all the manifestations observed  and all the information ob  tained as to how they are produced  such documents to be drawn up directly the sittings are over  signed with the names and addresses of witnesses  and posted to a central quarter where the records should be preserved and tabulated  the documents should be short  and contain nothing but scientific facts  for a scientific body would have nothing to do with the good or evil of spiritualism  or with the religious aspect of the ques  tion   its only business would be to find out what natural laws give the observed results  if a system of this kind were now at work  evidently great additional power in the way of investigation would be gained  eor instance  if a notification were sent to all the different circles  asking them at the next sitting to   learn as much as possible about how the moving of wooden articles is effected   when the reports afterwards came in from each circle  there would of course be a great mass of contradictions  arising from imperfections of spirits both in and out of the body  but soon a few glimpses of daylight would begin to shine through the mist  the comparison of the in  formation thus obtained by a few dozen well educated and intelligent circles  independently of each other  would be highly interesting to all engaged in the work  and the plan is good because it would cost nothing but paper and postage  in addition to the printing of a few circulars  abbreviated reports of the results might be published at once  not necessarily with the names of all the witnesses  if some of them are liable to persecution from connection with spiritualism  and the authenti  cated documents could be stored away  so as to form a most valuable little mine of information for the   insti  tution of scientific spiritualists   of the future  which is the best eyidence  two statements of facts observed are quoted below  one of   the statements being made by dr  john tyndall  f r s   m  r i   and the other by mr  s  c  hall  f s a   editor of the art journal  the first of the two statements was published in no  105 of the proceedings of the royal society  in a paper wherein professor tyndall describes the formation of incipient clouds produced in certain vapours by the action of light  he used a glass tube 2 8 feet long and 2 5 inches internal diameter  closed with flat discs of glass at the ends  by means of a stopcock and air pump the air was removed from the tube  after which a few bubbles of air were re admitted after passing through certain volatile liquids  from which the air took up traces of vapour  a bright parallel or conical beam of light from the electric lamp  was then passed along the axis of the tube  and the chemical rays in the light at once began to decompose the transparent vapour  and to form very curious clouds  the following quotation shows what he says he saw  when experimenting thus with vapour of hydriodic acid    how professor ttndall saw a fish  i have seen nothing so astonishing as the effect obtained  on the 28th of october  with hydriodic acid  the cloud ex  tended for about eighteen inches along the tube  and gradually shifted its position from the end nearest the lamp to the most distant end  the portion quitted by the cloud proper was filled by an amorphous haze  the decomposition which was progressing lower down  being here apparently complete  a spectral cone turned its apex towards the distant end of the tube  and from its circular base filmy drapery seemed to fall  placed on the base of the cone was an exquisite vase  from the interior of which sprung another vase of similar shape  over the edges of these vases fell the faintest clouds  resem  bling spectral sheets of liquid  from the centre of the upper vase a straight cord of cloud passed for some distance along the experimental tube  and at each side of this cord two in  volved and highly iridescent vortices were generated  the frontal portion of the cloud  which the cord penetrated  as  sumed in succession the forms of roses  tulips  and sunflowers  it also passed through the appearance of a series of beautifully shaped bottles  placed one within the other  once it pre  sented the shape of a fish  with eyes  gills  and feelers  the witnesses who saw dr  tyndall s tube experiments performed  were his two assistants  and mr  ladd  the philosophical instrument maker  now for mr  s  c  hall s narrative  which was written in a letter from him to judge edmonds of new york  and is here quoted from the british journal of photography how me  s  c  hall saw a spirit  i have a fact to relate  apropos of the trial of mumler par  ticulars of which have reached me  it is this   a few days ago  sitting with daniel home and seven other friends  my venerable and truly christian sister  who passed from earth about eight months ago  was enabled to be visible to me and those who were with me  she was not only not a spiritualist  but strongly and sternly objected to the  principle  as anti  christian or demoniacal  she had never been present at any manifestation  never would be  but not long before her de  parture  i said to her    i am sure god will permit you to visit me after you leave earth  you will be permitted to do so for my comfort  and as a helper on my way to christ  i wish you to promise that you will do so  if god gives you power   she did not absolutely make me the promise   but she did say    my dear brother  if it be for your good  and god s permits it  and he may do so i will be with you when he has called me from earth   when she appeared to us in my drawing  room  her face was so healthy so full of the red and white that exhibit health that at the moment i did not recognise her   for she had been two years confined to bed   died  of cancer  was a great sufferer  and was naturally reduced to a skeleton so to speak  suddenly i said  with ah exclamation    it is my sister     three blows were struck on the table  the eyes were closed she had been blind during the last ten years of her earth life possibly but for that i should not have recognised her   there was so marvellous a contrast between the face  as i saw it on her   death   bed  and the face as i saw it then   so healthful  so beautiful  so happy  smilin g   but the likeness was exact  for i recognised every feature after my exclamation   the hair exactly as she wore it  or plaited back  and the cap exactly as she wore it also  which the master of lindsay  the hon  mr  lindsay  called a  mutch   i  e   the cap of the old scottish model  she remained before us thus palpably for about two minutes certainly more than one  long enough for any photographer to have made a photograph of her   and i am very sure there would have been no difficulty whatsoever in taking such a photograph if the apparatus had been ready   that it would have been at once recognised by any person who knew her during her   life   here  and that it would have been as distinct and palpable as any photograph of any  so called  living persons  i have no doubt that each of the ei ght persons present would make exactly the statement i have made  dr  tyndall says he saw a fish form in the air  and his state  ment is corroborated by three witnesses  mr  s  g  hall says he saw a spirit form in the air  and his statement is corrobo  rated by eight witnesses  which is the best evidence   belief  belief is not a voluntary or a meritorious act  and is no more under the control of the individual than the colour of the eyes or the length of the nose  for instance  no reader of these lines can  by the hardest efforts of his own  possibly believe that the moon is a cucumber  yet it would be possible to do so if belief were under control

part  we have seldom seen a lucrezia who so thoroughly looked   the duchess   as this lady  her dress and whole appearance being quite magni  ficent  she pleads for the life of gennaro  at first mildly  but  receiving denials from the duke  her anger is gradually raised into fury  and she bursts forth in a splendid air  full of ven  geance  it was the first time either mrs  varley or mrs  prend had ever undertaken anything of the kind    solomon  king of iseael  nobody knows better than mrs  emma hardinge  the eminent medium  how to narrate a good story with effect  in one of her anecdotes she tells how she was dining with friends  in some american town  we forget where  and a messenger arrived in breathless haste  inviting her immediate attendance at a new circle then sitting in a neighbouring street    please come at once   said the excited messenger    solomon wants to speak to you     solomon     said mrs  hardinge    solomon who       solo  mon  king of israel   was the reply    i suppose you obtained that name through the physical manifestations     said mrs  hardinge    yes   replied the bearer  who did not know the full force of the remark  mrs  hardinge continued   then  tell solomon  king of israel  i am engaged at dinner with friends  and can t come   the messenger seemed to be very much startled by the answer  which  however  he delivered to the circle  but soon returned  saying    that she really must come  solomon wanted to speak to her very badly indeed   she accordingly went  and being a good seeing medium  at once knew more of the facts of the case than did the members of the circle  the table  which before her entrance had been bouncing up and down  and making a great clatter  then edged about very shyly and quietly  the members of the circle expressed their surprise at the falling off in the vigour of the manifestations  mrs  hardinge said    go on  solomon  don t be afraid of me  let me see what you can do   accordingly  up and down went the table with a violence  which placed its legs in danger of breaking    solomon   said mrs  hardinge    how long ago is it since i saw you buying up old hats about the streets of this city       three months   was the reply    solomon  now  tell me  what do you mean by coming here to deceive these good people in this manner    well   said solomon  who was not a bad sort of fellow at bottom    they wouldn t have nothin  else  and so i give it  em     a warning  this  to spiritualists who have a weak reverence for great names  the supply is sure to meet the demand  nov  19  1869  dr  thomas young on spirits  de  thomas young  tbe colleague of sir humphrey davy  and one of the predecessors of faraday and tyndall  as professor of natural philosophy at the royal institution  has placed on record some specula  tions of his own respecting spiritual beings  considered from a physical science point of view  dr  young was the first in this country to work out and advocate the wave theory of light  but he was crushed for the time being by the great weight of authority brought to bear against him by sir isaac newton and lord brougham  who held that light was not wave motion  but consisted of particles shot out with infinite velocity from the luminous source  it is now known that dr  thomas young was in the right  and professor tyndall  f r s   has scarcely delivered a single lecture on light within the last two years  in which he has not called attention to the eminence of young as a philosopher  and pointed out how his labours were long overlooked because of the eminence of those who held opposing opinions  strange to say  young held more accurate views in his day as to the nature of spiritual beings than fara  day and tyndall ever attained  notwithstanding the rich rain of evidence falling on every side of the latter philosophers evidence which they refused to examine  here is a long forgotten paragraph written by dr  thomas young  and the words thereof will live in history     we see forms of matter differing in subtilty and mobility under the names of solids  liquids  and gases  above these are the semi material existences which produce the phenomena of electricity and magnetism  and either caloric or universal ether  higher still perhaps are the causes of gravita  tion  and the immediate agents in attractions of all kinds  which exhibit some phenomena apparently still more remote from all that is compatible with material bodies   and of these different orders of beings the more refined and immaterial seem to freely pervade the grosser  it seems  therefore  natural to believe that the analogy may be continued still further  until it rises into existence absolutely immaterial and spiritual  we know not but that thousands of spiritual worlds may exist unseen for ever by human eyes  nor have we any reason to suppose that even the presence of matter in a given spot necessarily excludes those exist  ences from it  those who maintain that nature always teems with life wherever living beings can be placed  may therefore speculate with freedom on the possibility of independent worlds  some existing in different parts of space  others pervading each other  unseen and un  known  in the same space  and others again to which space may not be a necessary mode of existence   the spibitual libeaey  the only lending library in london for books on spiritualism and kindred subjects is that belonging to mr  james burns  bookseller and stationer  15  southampton row  holborn  w c  mr  burns has fitted up rooms on the premises wherein friendly meetings for the furtherance of the spiritual cause often take place  in the course of september last a meeting was held in these rooms  under the presidency of mr  coleman  to welcome an eminent american medium  mr  j  m  peebles  consul at trebizonde to the government of the united states  and one of the editors of the ba nner of light  the chief newspaper of the american spiritualists  at that meeting mr  burns narrated how he first began the formation of the spiritual library by the importation of a small box of books from new york  and how the undertaking grew gradually until his little establish  ment in wellington road  camberwell  became very well known to those who required scarce books on progressive sub  jects connected with man  the growth of modern spiritualism at last rendered it advisable for him to take his present more extensive and central premises  spiritualism is known to have no more unselfish and hard working advocate anywhere than mr  burns  in evidence of which it may be stated that  although he is the owner of one spiritual periodical  human nature  he placed every facility in the way of the issue of this new journal  the spiritualist  because he thought it would help the movement  there are so many points wherein the two periodicals entirely differ from each other that it is hoped that injurious competition has been avoided  the work that mr  burns has performed for many years past  makes it a duty on the part of spiritualists to strengthen his hands in every possible way in his new establishment  appaeitions  you can scarcely select bap hazard a dozen families  without finding one or two members of them who have received at the moment of the death of some near relative  a communication announcing the fact at a distance  these communications are often made by the dying person appearing to some member of the family at the moment of passing away  the death moment seems the most easy one in which to make such communications  notwithstanding the enormous number of such cases  some of them supported with such striking collateral proof as to remove all doubt  the pos  sessors of such information are afraid to narrate these interest  ing facts except under the seal of confidence  because the world at large ridicules that which it does not understand   varley  answees to coeeespondents  b  edinburgh  evidence is best obtained by industry in visiting different circles  selecting at first those where powerful physical manifestations are common  since these cannot be the result of imagination or credulity  much depends upon the medium  in london good physical media are rare  and the rush to obtain sittings with them is now very great  this is caused partly by the fact that it usually takes several years to develop the most striking manifestations through a medium  and partly because very many who see symptons of mediumship appearing in them  selves  get frightened  and will not allow the spirits to use them for manifestations  good physical media are much wanted in glasgow  and perhaps you find it the same in edinburgh  we thank you for your good wishes  nov  19  1869 the spiritualist 7 facts for non spiritualists  as this journal will necessarily often come under the observation of those who are not spiritualists  it has been thought judicious to reprint regularly on this and the next page  the following condensed evidence that spiri  tualism deserves serious investigation  the phenomena witnessed in spiritual circles are so extraordinary  and so unlike those coming within the ordinary range of human experi  ence  that it is quite right not to accept them on the testimony of others  each individual should witness and test them personally  and believe nothing until the absolute knowledge is gained that denial is impossible  evidence that sphtltualism desebves inves  tigation  the testimony of reliable and respectable wit  nesses that the phenomena of spiritualism are actual facts  and not imposture or delusion  has of late years so accumulated as to possess very great weight  in the case of lyon v  home  mr  eobert chambers  mr  0  f  varley  dr  gully  mr  and mrs  s  0  hall   and others  all made affidavits strongly in favour of mr  home  the following was the affidavit of mr  c  f  varley  c e   f e g s   m r i    i  oromwell fleetwood varley  of fleetwood house  beckenham  in the county of kent  esquire  make oath and say as follows     i have been a student of electricityv chemistry  and natural philosophy for twenty six years  and a tele  graphic engineer by profession for twenty one years  and i am the consulting electrician of the atlantic tele  graph company  and of the electric and international company    about nine or ten years ago  having had my atten  tion directed to the subject of spiritualism by its spon  taneous and unexpected development in my own family in the form of clairvoyant visions and commumcations  i determined to test the truth of the alleged physical phenomena to the best of my ability  and to ascertain  if possible  the nature of the force which produced them   accordingly  about eight years ago  i called on mr  home  the defendant in this suit  and stated that i had not yet witnessed any of the physical phenomena  but that i was a scientific man and wished to investigate them carefully    he immediately gave me every facility for the pur  pose  and desired me to satisfy myself in every possible way  and i have been with him on divers occasions when the phenomena have occurred  i have examined and tested them with him and with others  under con  ditions of my own choice  under a bright light  and have made the most jealous and searching scrutiny  i have been  since then  for seven months in america  where the subject attracts great attention and study  and where it is cultivated by some of the ablest men  and having experimented with and compared the forces with elec  tricity and magnetism  and after having applied me  chanical and mental tests  i entertain no doubt whatever that the manifestations which i have myself examined were not due to the operation of any of the recognised physical laws of nature  and that there has been present on the occasions above mentioned some intelligence other than that of the medium and observers    the subject of course offers many opportunities and inducements for fraud  and i only speak of what i have myself seen and tested  since my acquaintance with mr  home began i have pursued the enquiry  and i have found engaged in it able  learned  and scientific men  who are convinced as i am  that the physical manifesta  tions are but the introduction to an extensive field of mental and physical knowledge which will in a great measure explain and reconcile the beliefs of all ages and nations  i know of several instances both in europe and america in which this course of study has awak  ened the perception of the purest and loftiest truths and principles  there have been no doubt cases in which the intellect has been too feeble for the stimulus  and has been overpowered by it  just as frequently results from excessive application to religion and other exciting topics  but such cases have not come within my own observation    mr  home  like several other non professional me  diums whose cases i have studied  was passive during the occurrence of the manifestations  he  like the other mediums  is extremely susceptible to external in  fluences  and has a mind better suited to receive impres  sions than to prosecute enquiries  i willingly testify my entire conviction of his truthfulness and honesty    0  f  varley   it also came out in the evidence given at the trial  that mr  home had been the invited and un  paid guest of the emperor and the empress of the french  the emperor  empress  and the late em  press dowager of russia  the grand duke con  stantine  the king of prussia  the late king of bavaria  the late king of wurtemhurg   and the queen of holland  mr  home says that all his life he has never taken a farthing of pay for his seances  in march  1869

county of worcester  doctor of medicine  make oath and say as follows    i have known the above named defendant  daniel dunglass home  for seven years and upwards  last past  and have during that period been in the habit of attend  ing him professionally  and also of receiving him in my house as a personal friend  and i have never had the smallest reason to doubt his character as a man of honour and proper moral feeling    i have during the past seven years witnessed both in my own house  and elsewhere  in the presence of the said mr  home many curious occurrences  which i am unable to explain  in the way of singular phenomena  such as displacement of objects without physical con  tact   c   and from my personal and careful investiga  tions  which mr  home himself ever urges  i am positive that it is not in consequence of any trick or device that such phenomena occur  i have even been witness ti  singular phenomena when the said mr  home was not in the same room  and also when he has been asleep  i have never known the said mr  home receive money for what is termed  a seance   but i have known him re  peatedly refuse offers of as much as twenty guineas for a single stance

muscular action   theory explained all the facts  a friend wrote to him detailing things he had seen which were inexplicable by that theory  hare at once  like a sensible man  went to see for himself  the result was that he came into communication with some of his own departed relatives  he then made mechanical telegraphic machines  which were intelligently worked by spirits while the apparatus was screened from the sight of the medium  and he wrote a book recording all these facts  that book is now in the british museum library  judge edmonds  of new york  is another very eminent american

challenges   first  i challenge you  or either of you  or any of the public who  like you  disbelieve in the genuine cha  racter of spiritualistic phenomena  to deposit in the hands of any well known london banker whom you or they may name  the sum of five hundred guineas  and i pledge myself to immediately deposit in the same bank a like amount  the ownership of such sum of one thou  sand guineas to depend upon my proving by evidence sufficient to establish any fact in history or in a criminal or civil court of justice  first that intelligent communications and answers to questions put  proceed from dead and inert matter in a manner inexplicable by any generally recognised law of nature   secondly that dead and inert matter does move without the aid of any mechanical or known chemical agency  and in defiance of all the admitted laws of gravi  tation    thirdly that voices appertaining to no one in the flesh are heard to speak and hold rational converse with men   a jury of twenty four gentlemen  twelve to be chosen by each party  such jury to consist exclusively of mem  bers of the learned professions and literary men   to decide whether or not the facts contained in the above propositions are conclusively proved per testes i e   by witnesses of established character  a majority of the twenty four to decide  if the verdict be that these facts have not been established  the thousand guineas are to belong to the party accepting this challenge  if the verdict be that these facts are established  the thou  sand guineas to be mine    secondly immediately after the above wager being decided  either way  i offer a like challenge of five hun  dred guineas  to be met on the other side in like manner as above  the ownership of the second sum of one thousand guineas to depend upon the establishment of the facts contained in the propositions already given  by experiments conducted in the actual presence of the twenty  four gentlemen who have decided the previous wager  the verdict of the majority to decide in this case likewise     in either case  the stances are to be conducted in any public or private building which the jury may select  and which may be available for the purpose    the result of these challenges  if accepted and de  cided  to be advertised by the victorious party  at the expense of the defeated party  in all the london daily papers    i hope this is plain english    awaiting a reply to this letter  and to the challenge with which it concludes  i am  gentlemen  your obedient servant  g  damani   clifton  oct  1 1868   p s  letters addressed  sigr  damiani  care of manager of west of england and south wales district bank  com street  bristol   will always reach the writer   in addition to the above evidence  there is the testimony of numbers that the modem spiritual manifestations are realities  mr  hepworth dixon in his new america estimates the number of spiri  tualists in the united states at rather less than three millions  and this is about the lowest estimate that anybody has made  there are no accurate sta  tistics  and different authorities vary in their esti  mates from three to eleven millions  all these facts  together with those which follow  prove that spiritualism deserves serious investigation  not a few learned men have pri  vately been examining the phenomena in order to   explode the imposture   but these extinguishers soon catch fire themselves  in short  in the minds of most of the english public  spiritualism has to pass through the following five stages   1  the manifestations do not take place  2  spiritualism is a gross imposture  3  it is a delusion  4  it is the work of the devil  5  it is a great blessing  and we always said so  experience shows that the feebler the intellect  and the lower the standard of energy and educa  tion  the sooner does the investigator break down at one of the first four out of the above five steps in the ladder of progress  me  home s affidavit  in the chancery suit of lyon v  home  for the recovery of certain monies given by mrs  lyon to mr  home against the advice of her lawyer and her friends  mr  home made an affidavit  from which the following is an extract     i  daniel dunglass home  of 22  sloane street  in the county of middlesex  one of the above named de  fendants  make oath and say as follows    i was bom in scotland on the 20th of march  1833  and from my childhood have been subject to the occa  sional happening of singular physical phenomena in my presence  which are most certainly not produced by me or by any other person in connection with me  i have no control over them whatever  they occur irregularly  and even when i am asleep  sometimes i am many months  and once i have been a year without them  they will not happen when i wish  and my will has nothing to do with them  i cannot account for them further than by supposing them to be effected by intelli  gent beings or spirits  similar phenomena occur to many other persons     these phenomena ot jurring in my presence have been witnessed by tb asands of intelligent and respectable persons  including men fit business  science  and literature  under circumstances which would have rendered  even if i desired it  all trickery impossible  they have been witnessed repeat  edly and in their own private apartments  when any contrivance of mine must have been detected  by their majesties the emperor and the empress of the french  their majesties the emperor  empress and late empress dowager of russia  their imperial highnesses the grand duke and duchess constantine of russia and the mem  bers of their august family  their majesties the king of prussia  the late king of bavaria  the present and late king of wiirtemberg  the queen of holland  and the members of the boyal family of holland  and many of these august personages have honoured  and i be  lieve still honour  me with their esteem and goodwill  as i have resided in some of their palaces as a gentleman and their guest  and not as a paid or professional per  son  they have had ample opportunities  which they have used  of investigating these phenomena  and of inquiring into my character  i have resided in america  england  france  italy  germany  and russia  and in every country i have been received as a guest and friend by persons in the highest position in society  who were quite competent to discover and expose  as they ought to have done  anything like contrivance on my part to produce these phenomena  i do not seek  and never have sought  the acquaintance of any of these exalted personages  they have sought me  and i have thus had a certain notoriety thrust upon me  i do not take money  and never have taken it  although it has been repeatedly offered me for or in respect of these phenomena  or the communications which appear to be made by them  i am not in the habit of receiving those who are strangers to me  and i never force the subject of spiritualism on any one s attention     some of the phenomena in question are noble and elevated  others appear to be grotesque and undignified  for this i am not responsible  any more than i am for the many grotesque and undignified things which are undoubtedly permitted to exist in the material world  i solemnly swear that i do not produce the phenomena aforesaid  or in any way whatever aid in producing them    c    i have been subjected to much persecution through  out my life  because of my conscientious belief as to the meaning and great purpose of spiritual phenomena taken as a whole  that belief i have not  like the plaintiff  foresworn  i have always courted the strictest investigation  although i have not condescended  to notice all the attacks and anonymous slanders that have been circulated respecting me  the book shown to me at the time of swearing this affidavit  marked h 8  con  tains a correct list of upwards of 1 300 letters  with the writers  names  which i still retain  after having de  stroyed about 10 000   written to me by persons of every rank and class  including persons of the highest social  political  literary  and scientific position  who have in  vestigated these phenomena  and corresponded with me about them  after the fullest opportunities of examina  tion  they have formed different opinions as to their origin and meaning  but i believe that all are thoroughly satisfied of my entire honesty in the matter  and lately  while the plaintiff s base and unfounded charges of fraud and imposition have been hanging over me  and during the months of january and february  1868  these phenomena have been thoroughly tested by another scientific man  named mr  hawkins simpson  the inventor of electrical apparatus  including one for printing at a distance by the telegraph a drawing and description of which were  as i am in  formed and believe  given in the engineer newspaper of the  15th november  1867   omitting the remainder of mr  home s affidavit  the following evidence given by him before the dialectical society  is of interest     he had seen a pencil lifted by a spirit hand write on paper in the presence of the emperor napoleon  this took place in a large room  the salon louis quinze  the empress was also present  the hand  after writing  went to the emperor  who kissed it  it then went to the empress  she withdrew from the touch  and the hand followed her  the emperor said   do not be fright  ened  kiss it    she then kissed it  and it shortly after  wards disappeared  the writing was an autograph of the emperor napoleon i  the emperor of russia had also seen and handled spirit hands  which after  wards seemed to melt away into thin air   the emperor napoleon has been at a great many of mr  home s seances  and mr  home was asked by members of the dialectical society to state other things which had been observed on those occasions  mr  home said that he did not fee at liberty to state any more than the emperor was in the habit of telling himself  what is the use of spiritualism   strange to say there are people who can ask what is the use of communication with friends and relatives  who have passed the great barrier of the grave  one use of spiritualism is  that all spiritualists who lead moderately good lives  are found to gradually lose the fear of death  spirits through the agency of suitable media have much power in the healing of diseases  and the removal of deformities  though such power is far from absolute  the following is a narrative  published in daybreak  of some of the powers exercised through mr  newton  the best healing medium in the united states  he is expected to visit england in the course of  the year 1870  the following ex  ample from a very boundless field of choice  is enough for the present on the subject of the uses of spiritualism      friday  may 22  of the present year  1868  will for ever remain one of the most memorable days of my life  it was on that day  when the sun was shining brightly and bathing the world with its light and heat  that i arrived at newport   rhode island  and first came under the healing powers of dr  j  a  newton  i had heard of him through the spiritual magazine  mr  william howitt  and mr  coleman  and was assured that if i placed myself in his hands i should be speedily and radically cured of the neuralgic affection in my head  for which i had been suffering for eleven years  it was not until i had become a little more familiar with some of the facts and phenomena of modem spiritualism that i felt a quiet faith in the power of dr  newton to remove my disease  having once attained to that state of mind  and becoming satisfied that it was my duty  to cross the atlantic in search of health  i made arrange  ments for doing so  and left liverpool for new york on saturday  may 9  arriving at the latter place on tuesday evening  the 19th          the moment dr  new  ton and i met  i found in his face and simple kindly manner a human image of the outside sunshine  and but few words had   been spoken when i was convinced that the errand upon which i had come would be ful  filled  i was about to give him the history in detail of my affliction when he stopped me by saying   that after i had been cured he would be very glad to listen to anything i might wish to say  but that the cure itself was the first matter to be attended to   he then poured a large quantity of very hot water upon my head while i was leaning it over a basin into which the water fell  after my head had been dried with a coarse towel  i was made to sit upon a moveable seat  similar to a music stool  the doctor standing behind me  and placing my head against his chest with his hands crossed upon my forehead  he then moved my head in various directions until all at once a clicking noise was heard at the top of my spine  the doctor immediately cried out    that noise is the sign that you will be cured  the dis  turbance of the nerve current has been removed   he then faced me  and lifting both his hands towards heaven  he looked me hard in the face  saying   look at me  in the name of god our heavenly fattier  and of the lord jesus christ the great healer  i bid this disease depart from this dear suffering brother and never more afflict him  it is gone it is gone it is gone for ever  my brother  you are cured  rise up on your feet and be cured   at that instant i felt a strong current of new life flowing into and through every part of my body  and i was conscious that i had entered upon an altogether new phase of existence  from that day to the present hour  july 13  i have been entirely free from my pain  and have felt as  well  i should think  as it is possible for any human being to feel  physically speaking  i am a new creature  old things have passed away and all things have become new  of course it is not for me to say absolutely that the cure will be per  manent  but  if i may judge from my present expe  rience  i see no reason why it should not be  so  wonderful as my case is  it is only one of thousands  so far as dr  newton is concerned  he has cured almost every form of disease  and removed almost every kind of suffering  in fact  he appears to have done every  thing but raise the dead  and yet even he does not cure all cases  and this failure enables him to keep alive the consciousness that it is not he who cures  but god who works in and through him  he tells me that he has cured something like a quarter of a million of people          most of his cures are done without fee or reward  in my own case he steadily  refused to take a single dollar  and i saw him act in like manner towards several others  during my stay i witnessed several instances of his healing power  some of them being so manifest as to defy all attempts at explaining them away  on the very morning that my own cure was effected  i witnessed his cure of a paralytic who for three years had been unable to walk without the aid of crutches  and even then  only in a partial degree  this woman was brought by her parents to newport  and  in less than five minutes  from the time when she came under dr  newtonls hands  she got up from the couch on which she had been laid  and walked away up the  street and back again  a full mile  and afterwards   walked and ran and jumped and danced  as so many signs that her cure was a complete one  i also saw him cure a young man who had a withered hand  indeed  i might have seen day by day  and hour by hour  ex  amples of this healing power had i chosen to have done so  every now and again  there are trains from boston and providence freighted with the lame  the halt  the   blind  and the diseased  sometimes to the number of 500 or 600  these come to newport  and a large majo  rity of them are sent kw y perfectly cured  in one part of dr  newton s house there is a rooin of  considerable size  full of crutches  sticks  spectacles  eye^setdesr  bandages  and other memorials  bl  disease and sickness   which have been left behind by patients as so many signs and trophies of their cure                   frederick rowland young       minister of the free christian church  swindon   there are very many healing mediums in the united states  who can do good only in certain diseases  or whose powers are so feeble that suc  cessful results may with more probability of accu  racy be put down to the imagination of the patient  a great use of spiritualism is that it demon  strates the immortality of the soul  but why ask    of what use is spiritualism     for here the thing is in our midst as much a part of nature as the trees  the clouds  and the flowers   and as it cannot be abolished there is no alternative  but to subject it to inveetigation  or to  ooky u   t igno  rance  how to form spirit uirci r  i  an experimental trial at home  among family friends and relatives  often gives the most satis  factory evidence of the reality of spiritual pheno  mena  at the same time  as no fully developed medium is present among those who have never obtained manifestations before  the probability is that there will be no results  nevertheless  it is a very common thing for striking manifestations  to be obtained in this way at the first sitting of a family circle  perhaps for every one successful new circle thus started without a medium  there are six or seven failures  but np accurate statistics on this point have yet been collected  when once manifestations have been obtained they will gradually increase in power and reliability at suc  cessive sittings  the following is a good plan of action   1  let the room be of a comfortable temperature  but cool rather than warm  let arrangements be made that nov  19  1869   the spiritualist  nobody shall enter it  and that there shall be no inter  ruption for one hour during the sitting of the  circle  wets damp  and foggy weatherds bad for the production of physical phenomena   2  let the circle consist of four  five  or six individuals  about the same number of each sex  sit round an un  covered wooden table  with all the palms of the hands id contact with its top surface  whether the hands touch each other or not is usually of no importance  any table will do  just large enough to conveniently accommodate the sitters  the removal of a hand from the table for a few seconds does no harm  but when one of the sitters breaks the circle by leaving the table it sonfetimes  but not always  very considerably delays the manifestations  3  before the sitting begins  place some pointed lead  pencils and some sheets of clean writing paper on the table  to write down any communications that may be obtained  4  people who do not like each other should not sit in the same circle  for such a want of harmony tends to prevent manifestations  except with well developed physical mediums  it is not yet known why  belief or unbelief has no influence on the manifestations  but an acrid feeling against them is a weakening influence  6  before the manifestations begin  it is well to engage in general conversation or in singing  and it is best that neither should bo of a frivolous nature  a prayerful  earnest feeling among the members of the circle is likely to attract a higher and more pleasing class of spirits  6  the first symptom of the invisible power at work is often a feeling like a cool wind sweeping over the hands  the first manifestations will probably be table tiltings or raps  7  when motions of the table or sounds are produced freely  to avoid confusion  let one person only speak  and talk to the table as to an intelligent being  let him tell the table that three tilts or raps mean  yea   one means  no   and two mean  doubtful   and ask whether the arrangement is understood  if three signals be given in answer  then say    if i speak the letters of the alphabet slowly  will you signal every time i come to the letter you want  aud spell us out a message     should three signals be given  set to work on the plan proposed  and from this time an intelligent system of communication is established  8  afterwards the question should be put    are we sitting in the right order to get the best manifestations    probably some members of the circle will then be told to change seats with each other  and the signals will be afterwards strengthened  next ask    who is the medium     when spirits come asserting themselves to be related or known to anybody present  well chosen questions should be put to test the accuracy of the statements  as spirits out of the body have all the virtues and all the failings of spirits in the body  possibly at the first sitting of a circle symptoms of other forms of mediumship than tilts or raps may make their appearance  information respect  ing the many kinds of mediumship will be found in mrs  professor de morgan s book  from matter to  spirit  published by longmans  and this is a i good book to read before trying to start a new circle  it usually takes several years for any medium to attain full power  and it is not an uncommon although not an everyday thing  for chairs and other articles to move about in the presence of a good well developed physical medium without anybody touching the articles at all  this fact effectually disposes of faraday s   unconscious muscular action   theory  some have suggested that the phenomena are all mental  since mental conditions influence their production  and that those present all believe they see and hear things which they do not in reality see and hear  the answer is that there is sometimes such a noise with improperly powerful manifestations that the sounds are heard all over the house by persons not in the room  the furniture sometimes gets broken by movements of too violent a character  and the broken portions remain as evidence that the phenomena were not of a mental character  the upholsterers  bills which result also serve to convince that the occurrences are facts  the higher spirits seem to have little power over common matter  and the highest communications are not usually obtained through physical mani  festations  there are in england several very interesting circles for physical manifestations  where the spirits spoak with audible voices  but  unfortu  nately  total darkness is a necessary condition  fton spiritualists who are inquiring into the sub  ject should have nothing to do with dark seances  which should be held only by those who  know each  other isince  they offer  so m^hy facilities  for fraud     when any circle regularly obtains powerr ful physical manifestatiohs itlmy may desite to  sit   for  the\\v6ices  the  very slightest   glimmer  of  light must  ^excluded frpjh   the   rop^   wiiile  the members of  the cirglevsit gojind ^tjhe^tad^  invthe    ordinary way

after  ^fe^ ds   wey^ayhef dispensed with except when pthe  weather and other conditions are unfavour   abie  when first trying to obtain the voices the   spirits may  not be able to lift the tubes from the table  afterwards they  often get them up in the air a foot or two and let them drop again  when they get full control over them they can carry them about up to the ceiling and to all parts of the room  and they talk to the members of the  circle often while floating about above their heads  very beautiful luminous phenomena are some  times shown by the spirits at dark circles  while sitting for the voices  the spirits will tell by the ordinary table signals how they are progressing in their work of getting control of the tubes    by the aid of the mediumship of mr  d  d  home  whose sittings nearly always take place either in bright or subdued light  the spirits sometimes make themselves visible  so as to be recognised by   those who know them  and to be seen by all present  there are two ways of seeing spirits  in the first case the spirits materialise their own forms till they become visible to everybody  in the second the spiritual powers of the individual are temporarily or permanently brought into play  and he becomes a   seeing medium   every human being is surrounded by an atmo  sphere which to the spirits is luminous and mate  rial  and this atmosphere is largely used by the spirits in the production of the physical manifes  tations  baron beichenbach  while he knew nothing of spiritualism  discovered by experiment the presence of unknown forces emanating from human bodies  and published the results in his hesearches on animal magnetism  all the pheno  mena of spiritualism draw temporarily upon the vital powers of those composing the circle  but the medium is the chief source of energy  a still atmosphere and subdued light in the room are favourable conditions for the physical manifestations  spiritualism and men of science  lord brougham and sir david brewster many years ago had a seance with mr  home  every facility was given them for investigation  they witnessed some remarkable manifestations  and  deeply impressed  parted with mr  home on the most friendly terms  some little time afterwards brewster  finding that he was much laughed at for his testimony  began gradually to back out of his first position  and to say that possibly trickery was at the root of the manifestations  this led to angry letters in the newspapers   full par  ticulars are published in mr  home s incidents of my life  lord brougham did not support brews  ter in his later assertions  sir 3  emerson tennant once invited faraday to a seance at which mr  home was to be the medium  faraday wrote and asked for a pro  gramme df the manifestations  and as nobody knows beforehand what will take place at a circle any more than the details of an expected star  shower can be given in advance  it was not pos  sible to comply with bis demand  faraday also required an answer to the following questions  among others  before attending    would he [mr  home] he glad if their [the manifesta  tion s] delusive character were established and exposed  and would he gladly help to expose it  or would he be annoyed and personally offended  [the italics in this sentence are not in the original ]   does he consider the effects natural or supernatural   if natural  what are the laws which govern them  or does he think that they are not subject to laws  if supernatural  does he suppose them to be miracles  or the work of spirits   if the work of spirits  would an insult to the spirits be considered as an insult to himself   mr  home took no notice of the above insults  and  it is believed  never wrote faraday in the first instance  or took any notice of him whatever  he never even saw his letters  dr  john tyndall  f r s   in a note dated may 8  1868  commenting upon faraday s letter just mentioned  wrote     i hold myself in readiness to witness and investigate  in the spirit of the foregoing letter [of faraday s]  such phenomena as mr  home may wish to reveal to me during the month of june    a few days previously mr  home had written in the pall mall gazette     it will give me pleasure to meet professor tyndall  and any two gentlemen he shall designate  on my side i shall have at least two gentlemen whose names and position place them above the suspicion of aiding or abetting a fraud  i will meet professor tyndall and these gentlemen when and where they please  and under such circumstances as they may decide on  i must only cravp their patience if nothing should occur at the first  or even the second  siance   from that day to this dr  tyndall has not accepted the above invitation  possibly it would be no use if he did  for mr  home is like a sensi  tive plant  which is one reason why he is so pliant in the hands of spirits  and the presence of any  body he does not like interferes seriously with the very wonderful manifestations which we have seen take place in his presence  dr  tyndall s best plan  if he desire to gain knowledge  is to invite some medium  who gets common violent physical manifestations  to meet him at the royal institution  these great errors on the part of faraday and tyndall are here put on record with regret  for men of their stamp deserve higher honours at the hands of a nation than any others whatever  their intellectual standing is of the very noblest order  but  from a psychological point of view  their letters show  them to be imperfect  faraday is now in a position to know and repent of his errors  as for dr  tyndall  assuming that the dwellers in the spirit land wish to and know how to commu  nicate with men  a glimmering of a great idea may at last get inside his head  namely  that it is just possible that the hosts of heaven may go on with their work without asking his consent  however  we believe him to be very honourable and fearless  and   think  that when he knows the facts to be true ii   will  jgovbeh ind the j oyal institution table and say   sp   publicly  7 1 a demand for a programme where no programme can be giyen     and

mind ihd follomhg words of galileo       oh  my dear kepler  how i wish that we could have our hearty laugh together  here  at padua  is the prin  cipal professor of philosophy  whom i have repeatedly and urgently requested to look at the moon and planets through my glass  which he pertinaciously refuses to do  why are you not here   what shouts of laughter we should have at this glorious folly  to hear the professor of philosophy at pisa  labouring before the grand duke with logical arguments  as if with magical incantations to charm the planets out of the sky    several eminent members of the royal society and of the institution of civil engineers  have recently been privately investigating spiritualism  j and know it to be true  till they choose to attach their names publicly to an unpopular truth  it is not our business to do it for them  so names must be withheld  a little society imown as the dialectical society  is now investigating spiritualism  it numbers among its members many shrewd and intelligent men  belonging chiefly to the legal and medical professions  spiritualists watch its proceedings with a moderate amount of interest  nothing that any man or body of men may say or do can alter the established phenomena and laws of nature  the literature of spiritualism  the literature of spiritualism now consists of several hundreds of volumes  good  bad  and indif  ferent  and almost entirely of american origin  among the best volumes on the subject are mrs de morgan s from mattes  to spirit  longmans   with a preface by professor de morgan  president of the mathematical society of london  the planchette  by epes sargent  spiritualism  2 vols    by judge edmonds and g  t  dexter  of new york  a history of spiritualism  by emma hard  inge   and the autobiography of andrew jackson davis  an interesting book  consisting simply of narrations of facts witnessed at remarkable seances  is incidents of my life  longmans   by d  d  home  the soul of things  by denton  is a curious book indirectly connected with spiritualism  and worth reading  those unacquainted with spiri  tualism are recommended to read these books in the order in which they have just been mentioned  the only large lending library of spiritual books in great britain is that belonging to mr  j  burns  15  southampton row  high holborn  london  w c  the english periodicals on the subject are  the spiritual magazine  human nature  day  break  and the spiritualist    advice to inquirers  those who know no intelligent spiritualists  and nothing about spiritualism  yet who want to investigate  are recommended to begin by reading the first two books mentioned in the preceding paragraph  then they should call upon the chief publisher of spiritual books in london  mr  j  burns  15  southampton row  holbom  where they are sure to be treated with attention and courtesy   and ask  for the names and addresses of say four good professional or non professional mediums  accessible to the public  and   recognised by spiri  tualists as reliable for powerful physical manifes  tations   there are plenty of mediums o r of people who fancy themselves mediums  who can rarely show anything satisfactory  and with whom an inquirer might waste much  time  he should then get say two sittings by daylight in his own house with each of the four mediums  because the power varies in strength at times with every medium  at the end of the eight sittings he is sure to be thoroughly interested in spiritualism  and to have thrown overboard the imposture theory  which is the clumsiest and most superficial one of all  many of the public have vague ideas that electri  city can do all kinds of unaccountable things  but a genuine medium never has any hesitation j in sitting with a circle in a house and among furniture which he or she has never seen in his or her life before  evfen with a good medium it is best  if time be valuable^ not to investigate at crowded public circles  because  assuming imposture to be at work  there is no telling who may not be aiding  among the numerous spectators  besides  where so many people want to ask questions of the spirits  the investigator has not time to put many himself  investigators are recommended to be thus careful in the selection of mediums  because as public attention is gradually more rivetted upon spiri  tualism  impostors are sure to spring up  and even to advertise in spiritual periodicals  for the editors manifestly cannot investigate the claims of every professing medium  at present  november  1869  there is verjr little imposture mixed up with the spiritual movement in great britain  and there are only four or five paid mediums in all london  good paid mediums deserve high praise rather than that censure which is thrown upon them even by spiritualists   they find house room  they are ready to receive strangers at stated times when private circles could not sit for the convenience of inquirers  the sittings exhaust their vitality like a hard days  work   and they have to put up with much abuse when uneducated roughs unaccus  tomed to investigation persecute them by attend  ing  the inquirer should mention to the medium  civilly and kindly  his doubts respecting the phenomena  he may witness  the invisible beings around will at once  on the spot  do their best to remove those doubts  or an explanation will be obtained from the medium   when there is real foundation for suspicion  the best plan is to go often to the medium  accompanied by witnesses  detect the imposture  and prosecute the medium for obtaining   money under false pretences  genuine manifestations are not under the control of the medium  so that a paid medium who does not get manifestations  is under a greait temptation to try to make them  this fact makes it difficult for spiritualists to speak absolutely as to the relia  bility of any paid mediums  however genuiue the majority of the manifestations may be which occur in their presence  after getting thoroughly inte  rested in spiritual phenomena  the inquirer should take his friends to see them  and afterwards gef up a private circle in his own house    manifestations will mo^t likely  not be obtained at thp first  sitting  but aft er y erjf few qr very many sittings  they will febnie j  gradually the  great  barrier of thegravo which now separates friendswjjlbe brolcondown   and after the experience of a  year or two the dread    gf the   beautiful  natural process  called fl death   will 6e destroyed  as it is destroyed in the minds of all experienced spiritualists  except those who during life have done harm to their fellow creatures  very high spirits and their homes ar  perfectly invisible to very low spirits  this  coupled with the fact that there is no more uniformityin the next world than there is here  accounts for the endless contradictions about spirit life given in spiritual communications  an investigator of a logical and scientific turn of mind may possibly have to closely follow up the subject for some weeks before gaining the absolute knowledge that the manifestations come from spirits  unlike mr  home and a few other excep  tional individuals  most mediums are developed for one or two special purposes only  thus  vio  lent physical manifestations  inexplicable by any of the recognised laws of matter  may be seen in the presence of one medium  but mental tests and questions may bring forth a majority of inaccurate and unreliable answers  where good mental tests are obtainable through a medium  the physical manifestations may be altogether absent  joseph barker s autobiography  now ready  neatly bound in cloth  price 2s  6d  teachings of experience  or  lessons i have learned on my way through life    at the time he told me of these things  i had become rather uncharitable towards the spiritualists  and very distrustful of their statements  and the consequence was  that my friend s account of what he had witnessed  and of the effect it had on his mind  made but little im  pression on me  but when i saw things resembling what my friend had seen  his account of what he had witnessed came back to my mind with great power  and helped to increase my astonishment         the result of my visit to dr  redman was  that i never afterwards felt the same impatience with spiritualists  or the same inclination to pronounce them foolish or dishonest  that i had felt before  it was plain  that whether their theory of a spirit world was true or not  they were excusable in thinking it true  it looked like truth   pp  163  164  london  james beveridge  9  10  11  fullwood s rents  holborn  w o    to life policy holders    the recent disclosures in the chancery court indis  putably prove that neither the antiquity of a life office nor the magnitude of its income  affords to the public any security that the premiums they have paid for the purpose of securing a sum of money to their families may not be frittered away in costly amalgamations  or jeopardised by fire  marine  or accidental risks  in order to remove this insecurity the british im  perial insurance corporation was esta  blished on the principle substantially adopted by her majesty s government for small policies  and carried out through the medium of the post office  the life funds of the british imperial corporation are placed beyond the control of the directors  being in  vested in the government funds  for the sole purpose of meeting policy claims  in the names of trustees  who act independent of the directors  and solely on behalf of the policy holders  the system of investing insurers  net premiums in consolidated three per cent  annuities in trustees  names for the sole purpose of meeting policy claims  combined with the creation of a number of separate  trusts  presents entirely new elements of security to insurers  such principles are in contradistinction to those of ordinary life insurance  where all the premiums paid by insurers are under the sole control of a central board  exercising power to invest them in almost any description of security at home or abroad  any section of the community who are dissatisfied with the ordinary plan of entrusting their premiums to the care of the directors of a life office may  without cost or risk  constitute themselves into a separate sec  tion of the british imperial corporation  and appoint their own trustees to control the life insurance funds contributed by them  life policies  if only in force for

inches in length  is cut into strips of one inch in breadth any bookbinder will do this  2  place one of these strips in the tin plate holder  which covers half an inch of each end  3  take a piece of camphor about the size of a bean  put it on a plate or other convenient place and ignite it  4  pass the paper in its holder several times rapidly over the top of the flame  not in the flame  as this would burn in the smoke and prevent the needle removing it easily  we thus get a strip of paper with five inches of its surface properly smoked and ready for use  5  when the tracing has been made  write on the paper with something pointed  e g   a toothpick  the patient s name  his position     standing    lying    sit  ting   the pressure of the spring  the date  and any short note you wish to make  bemarks  it is best to make these smoked papers at home  and to ca^ry them to the patient s house in a small box provided for that purpose  and to replace them in the box when the tracing is made  in order to convey them home to be varnished  directions for varnishing the smoked papers  the best varnish for this purpose is that used by photo  graphers  called crystal varnish  a glass vessel about six inches high and 1j inch in diameter is filled with this varnish  and the smoked paper dipped into it for a second and then withdrawn  the varnished paper  smoked side uppermost  is then laid on a piece of blot  ting paper  in two minutes it is perfectly dry  and ready for fixing in the case book  the instrument is manufactured by  and can now be obtained from mr  john ganter  of 19  crawford street  montague square  london  except that the traces were thought to be large enough  there was no reason why dr  dudgeon s sphygmographs should not have been made to magnify the pulse vibrations many more than fifty times  in fact  he has one in his possession which gives larger sphygmo  grams than usual  as sphygmography be  comes more studied  and critical questions arise as to the causes of small variations in the curves  no doubt larger instruments will come into use  dr  dudgeon s instrument is defective in that it is too small for advanced students  here and there the white line in the tracings is sometimes thickened by the smaller vibrations of the needle  the curves of these portions being lost instead of being saved by a larger sweep of the pointer  and a quicker motion of the paper  the first portion of the descending part of the curve  down to the aortic notch  is that which is alone of value in most of dr  purdon s re  searches  and it would have been advantageous were this section given on a larger scale  another easily remedied defect is  that after having put the instrument in its place  the present method of fastening the band tends to pull it from its true position  especially when the sphygmograph is used on the left wrist  where there is no resistance of the bone against the adverse pull due to the act of clamping  the following method of preparing the tracing papers has been devised and success  fully used for a long time by staff sergeant fall  station hospital  guernsey  march  1882  sir  the apparatus designed by me for carbonising sphygmograph papers  consists of a wooden box  22 inches long  10 inches wide  and 8 inches deep  lined with tin on the bottom and sides  together with a perforated sheet of the same metal placed transversely in the centre  so  p s o     3 _ the papers  which should be cut the required size  are slipped over studs permanently fixed to the sides of the top  thus forming a roof to the box  which at other times is left open together with the lower half of one end  which is kept for the introduction of an iron basin fixed to the end of aflat piece of iron sufficiently long to reach to the end of the box  and to which is affixed a wooden handle  a little wet sand or earth is then put in this vessel with about half an ounce of camphor in pieces placed here and there  so as to prevent melting into a mass and causing a large flame which would give much heat and little smoke  the vessel is then moved slowly backwards and forwards  by which means the smoke passes through the perforated tin  and deposits the car  bon on the paper  twenty of these papers can be made at one time   and of course more according to 1 he length of the box  with a proportional increase of camphor  about ten minutes is  as a rule  long enough to impart to the sphygmographic papers the necessary amount of darkness to enable the needle of the instrument to write sharply  if kept longer than this  the papers leave a thick deposit of carbon which is tilted off by the needle  thus spoiling the trace  the object in having a parti  tion of perforated tin in the centre of the box  is to prevent the papers from being burnt or scorched  in which case the needle passes over the paper without marking  after each time the apparatus is used it would be well to take a hand brush and sweep the sheet of tin  the holes of which soon become choked with soot  there  by causing much loss of time  and failure  if the papers are required to be made in large quanti  ties  a second box could be constructed with the roof and one end open for the first one to fit in  so that the smoke escaping from the first box  might be utilised for carbonising a second row of papers placed on the top of the second box  the upper end of which should be closed to prevent the exit of the smoke  it is necessary to add that on account of the exceeding blackness of the smoke arising during the use of this apparatus  it should not be used in a drawing room  or in a place where works of art are kept  i would there  fore recommend those who wish to adopt the above plan of making sphygmographic papers  to do so in an empty room where free ventilation exists  the inhalation of carbon is not conducive to good health  as plainly mani  fested by the mortality caused by the late london fogs  i have the honor to be  sir

of the theosophisi  bom  bay  madame blayatsky says about mr  eg  linton s visit to india    we refused going to calcutta to meet him  and felt obliged to deny ourselves and our numerous members  [of the bombay theosophical society  ]   the instructive pleasure of seeing him here  as was several times proposed  we have done so intentionally  feeling that we had no right to subject him to insulting suspicions  such as we had ourselves to suffer from  and which once we were brought together would be sure to follow in our trail  we abstained from seeing him  and spoke even of his work but casually once or twice in this journal  and only for the purpose of giving publicity to some wonderful phenomena of his         we would never advise a professional medium  unless he is a coarse fibred charlatan  to bring to india his   angel guides     it is hard upon anglo indians if they are to have no choice between witnessing psy  chical phenomena either through the powers of madame blavatsky or through coarse  fibred charlatans  this is riot the first time that individuals with psychical powers have done their best to enforce somewhat similar alternatives  it is an old story  madame blavatsky says     our cautious policy inspired by a natural feeling of deli  cacy more for his sake than our own was misunderstood nnd misinterpreted by our best friends   a feature of materialism  a few evenings ago in one of his usual clear and sparkling sunday evening addresses to the marylebone society of spiritualists  at the quebec hall  25  great quebec street  marylebone  mr  mac donnell criticised robert ingersoll the american atheist  and his work  he commended his honesty and efficient action  but argued that the universal acceptance of his teachings would be de  structive to human happiness  and crushing to the hopes and aspirations of man  he however considered a certain amount of such work as ingersoil s to be good for the world  good for religion  good for spiritualism at the present time  men must clear the ground before they could build upon it efficiently  and persons like ingersoll who pulled up rotten piles  destroyed shams and applied the 3  s it o zee de  31 hammer to worthless images  were but clear  ing the ground which spiritualism would afterwards quietly enter and occupy  image breakers of ingersoil s class could not per  manently extirpate anything that was good  mesmerism at folkestone  a few evenings ago some mesmeric experi  ments were performed in the schoolrooms of the congregational chapel at folkestone  by mr  turner  a working man  who differed from all other lecturers i have heard  by saying not a word from first to last  an ex  ample which might be imitated with ad  vantage in the house of commons  mr  kerr did the speaking for him  and performed the first experiment by mesmerising mr  turner himself till he fell insensible upon the platform  his body was then made rigid by passes  and placed horizontally in the air  with his head resting on the back of one chair and his heels on the back of another  with no intermediate support  while he was in this position dr  perry testified that his heart was beating all right  when mr  turner was  brought to   he proceeded with  success to mesmerise others  this is interesting because a mesmerist is usually supposed to possess much will power  and mesmeric sensitives little  in our opinion the will is a much less potent force in all mesmeric operations than is popularly supposed  mr  bent entertained the observers with some conjuring  and a cleverly delivered german song  lizzie gannon  lizzie gannon  of 141  hudson street  boston  mass   who  as mentioned in our last  has been almost constantly in a trance and speechless since a priest took away an image which had a mesmeric effect upon her  is still slowly sinking in strength  and wasting away  some of the boman catholic church officials have exhausted their ceremonies over her without conferring any benefit  and dr  hodges  one of the best medical men in boston  says he can do nothing for her  dr  j  r  newton could probably cure her  spiritual realities and materialistic shadows  in looking over my notes of the only sermon i ever heard preached by mr  stopford brooke  i find that in speaking of the practical and materialistic tendencies of the time  more especially in this country  he said that if any man as his years advanced became more practical at the expense of losing all of the ideal in his nature  all ennobling passion  and became a mere cold clay heap  it was not be  coming practical but becoming paralysed  all the real imagination and worship of the heart have fled away from such a man  who is then one of the saddest sights in the world  a russian ghost story  i have received the following letter    sir  two hundred miles to the north east of moscow is a place called kostroma  and it may be said to be on the borders of european civilisation  for the forest com  mences there and stretches almost un brokenly up to archangel  my correspondent  a russian lady  writing from that quarter  sends me the following ghost story  which i copy and send you  and here let me congratulate you on the neat appearance of our new acquaintance  psyche  and wish for it a useful and profitable career  my friend writes     we have had here lately a strange incident that will interest you  in one of the villages at some distance from us a workman who was a great drunkard died from the consequences of a drunken brawl  and it is rumoured that his spirit has appeared in different places and has been seen by several people  a little peasant boy asked one afternoon leave from his father to go to sleigh down a hill  as the children do here for the whole winter  the father who was cross at the time  sent him to all the d s  however  the boy went  and did not come home until midnight  when he appeared in a most miserable condition and swooned as soon as he entered the room  he related later on that he had been taken by the spirit of the deceased man who made him walk through almost impossible places  beating him when he would not obey  and lifting him through places where he could not walk  is the child a medium   did he really see what he related  or was it a bad dream that he had while he slept in some outhouse   he was bruised in the arms and legs  the mother of our schoolmistress  who went to seethe child  says that there were on his arms bruises like impressions of five fingers  however  it is difficult to get at the truth of the whole  h ere the people think that the father sending his son to the d   gave the evil spirit power to play such tricks upon him   the dream theory will not i think account for the five finger marks that the boy had on his arms  or for the other bruises  the opinion formed by the people may be and is no doubt highly orthodox  but not necessarily correct  i will answer for the cultured intelligence and truthfulness of my correspondent  who is known to many london spiritualists  but whose name  without her per  mission i could not give you for publication  joseph swinburne  9  dorchester place  blandford square  london  april 5th  1882  a discovery in india  one of our contributors writes   u i have had another interesting letter from my son  who has been for some months out on a surveying ex  pedition for the rectification of maps  along the banks of the indus  he tells me of some excavations by a mr  barlow  whose acquaintance he has made  i will quote from his letter     he has lately been making some most interesting excavations at a village called koterah   n  w  p   he has brought to light a quantity of  supposed  buddhist remains  estimated to be about  p siren  e   32 2 500 years old  consisting of plaster casts of heads  human figures  cornices  and other ornaments  they display a very high class of art  and bear so strong a resemblance to the old greek sculptures  that i cannot help fancying the greeks must have had some hand in their production  especially as all this part of the country is well known to have been conquered by alexander  through mr  barlow s kindness  i was enabled to make some sketches of some of the most striking examples  and also a sketch of the village where they are dis  covered     the crime of   qvaksalveri   under the laws of denmark  mr  c  e  taylor  the leading man among the spiritualists of st  thomas  danish west indies  and an occasional contributor to these pages  has been prosecuted by the danish government at the instigation of councillor a  h  riise the only apothecary in the town  for practising mesmerism and selling homoeo  pathic pills  the charge was the criminal one of qvaksalveri  which the judge defined to be   the taking of patients under cure with  out having legal authority      the prosecution was chiefly founded upon an old act dated 1672  as there was no question that mr  taylor had both practised mesmerism and cured people by it gratuitously  he was pro  nounced a criminal in the following terms   [free translation ^ extract from the sentence protocol of st  thomas jurisdiction  on friday 23rd december  1881  at 2 o clock p m   was pronounced in the special town court  st  thomas  in the criminal suit no  46  1881  lawyer petersen  for the complainant  versus  bookseller c  e  taylor  the following sentence    according to the government order of the 15th  last month  action was taken in this case against bookseller c e  taylor  or  as he himself declares his full name to be  edwin  william charles bernardo taylor  of st  thomas  for quackery and illegal sale of medicines  in regard to the first clause it is according to the de  fendant s own acknowledgement  which agrees with what else had been elucidated  proved that he  who has no right  to practice medicine in this country  has in the last two or three years taken sick persons of different classes under treatment  and has used a manner of treatment  which from the description he has given of the same  and to use his own term  must be classed under the denomin  ation of animal magnetism  besides  defendant  in some instances  has given his patients homoeopathic pills  according to the depositions made in the case  it is mainly for internal sickness such as from fever  dropsy  thrush  and epilepsy  that the defendant  in this way  has taken people under treatment  and he has besides ex  plained that he has only taken people under his care at their own desire  and also that he has never asked nor received payment from his patients  notwithstanding that it is not proved that the defen  dant s treatment has been detrimental to those treated by him  it appears  even from several of the descriptions in the case  that several of his patients have felt soothing and curative effects from the treatment used  he cannot be exempted from being punished according to the law of 5th september  1794  section 5  for his above mentioned deeds  as far as concerns the action for illegal sale of medi  cines  it must be considered  from the explanations given by him  sufficiently proved that he in his book store in this town  has had for several years a stock of homoeo  pathic medicines and homoeopathic sugar balls which he has imported partly from new york and partly from europe  these medicines the defendant  it is said  de  livered gratuitously to people who applied to him for them  he denies having sold medicines  as he only sold books containing homoeopathic directions for the use of them  and with the sale the medicines followed without a particular payment  it must  however  be considered just that the defendant s way of acting constitutes a real sale  not only of the books but also of the accompanying medicines  defendant s deeds ought  therefore  in that respect be considered to be an infringement of the laws  especially the law of 4th december  1672  section 30  and placard of 1st december  1779  against the sale of medi  cines in general and foreign medicines in particular  out  side of the apothecary shop  the defendant  who states that he was born in london  12th june  1843 and who has not been found formerly accused or punished here in these islands will  accord  ing to what has been stated above  be punishable  accord  ing to the cited laws  by a fine of  76 80  to be shared according to rescript of 12th october  1759  and royal resolution 27th february  1788  and besides the stock of homoeopathic medicine in hand liable to be confiscated  and payment of court expenses  the case having been properly conducted  it is there  fore  decided  that the defendant  edwin william charles bernardo taylor  ought to pay a fine of  76 80  to be shared according to rescript 12th october  1759  and royal resolution  27th february  1788  also to pay court expenses  besides the homoeopathic remedies ought to be confiscated  the above fine to be paid and the sentence executed according to law within fifteen days after it is legally served  signed  h  hanschell  const  correct extract confirmed  signed  h  hanschell  const  the wretched criminal  still unrepentant at having healed the sick for nothing  is actually dissatisfied with the foregoing sentence  and has appealed against it  the governor of the island and nearly all the leading inhabitants have expressed sympathy for him  hut are powerless against the law  mr  taylor has  under advice  prepared a petition to the king of denmark  for leave to work as a mes  merist   this will he accompanied hy a memorial containing an account  he says  of his studies in psychology  the many cures he has effected when all other means had proved futile  the prosecution that has been instituted ip s  2  c ik e 33 against him  and the desire of rthe people of the island that his services should he recog  nised  and he be allowed to continue to do good  this recommendation has been signed by the chairman  vice chairman  secretaries  and other members of the colonial council  the prosecuting and defending lawyers  nearly every one of the consuls  and all the leading merchants and inhabitants of st  thomas  the unanimity with which this has been done is a sufficient proof how profoundly stirred are the danish west indian people at such old laws being raked up to injure and ruin a man  a test spirit photograph  spirit photography is a reality  but so open in all directions to easy imposition upon the uninitiated  as to be the most dangerous section of all the phenomena of spiritualism for the publication of any cases which are not of the closest test character  at present the careless publication of weak cases of alleged materialisation phenomena  is making a perfect wreck of the reputation of spiritualism in america  as it had begun to do here until the system was checked of printing any cabinet seances which were not of a test character  spirit photography is more dangerous ground even than cabinet seances  the following valuable piece of evidence has been sent me as it was printed in the kansas city journal  of march 19th  1882    actual experience with an artist in kansas city  i desire to state briefly my experience lately had relative to the phenomenon known as spirit photography given through mrs  lizzie carter at the photographic gallery of mr  julius ploetz  no  618  main street  this city  the subject having elicited much interest among in  vestigators in this city and vicinity  many of those who had sat for a photograph with the lady claiming to recognise in the spirit faces produced in their pictures the familiar faces of departed friends  it was pro  posed to mrs  carter to give a photograph under test conditions  to which she cheerfully consented  con  sequently on the 4th inst  mr   w  w  judson  mrs  fred  meyers  mrs  h  m  johnson  mr  john e  flemming  and your humble servant constituted ourselves a committee to investigate this phase of mediumship  and we lay herewith before your readers the details of our investigation and its result  we first procured a plate holder in mr  ploetz s gallery  fitting the camera through which mr  carter operated  and with it proceeded to the photographic gallery of messrs  williams and thomson  612  main street  and requested mr  thomson  one of the pro  prietors  to place in that plate holder  in  our presence  a prepared plate for taking a photograph  stating to him that we desired him to go with us  as we wanted the photograph taken by another photographer at another gallery in his presence  for scientific investigation  the plate was prepared by the operator at the gallery of williams and thomson in our presence  placed in the plate holder  the plate was then wrapped in a covering by mr  thomson to exclude the light  and carried by mr  thomson thus we returned together to the gallery of mr  ploetz  mr  thomson was here introduced to mrs  carter  and requested to hand to her the plate holder  the background in mr  ploetz s gallery had been covered over with a plain white curtain  mrs  carter requested that the camera in which she intended to place the plate holder be examined  which was accord  ingly done by mr  d  p  thomson  as an expert in pho  tography  next your humble servant was invited to sit for a photograph  there were present at the time in the room the following named persons   mrs  virginia j  judson  mr  w  w  judson  m1 1 h  m  johnson  mr  j  robinson  mr  john e  flemming  mr  fred  meyers  mr  d  p  thomson  photographer  all of kansas city  mo   and mr  jacob sherman  of astoria  long island  mrs  carter  who had not for a moment left the room  now placed the camera in position  removed the covering from the plate holder  placed it in the camera without having opened it  and after the lapse of eight seconds  during which time she  placed her hands on the camera  removed the plate holder  and without opening it handed it back to mr  thomson  with the request to go to his own gallery to develope the plate  the committee followed mr  thomson to his gallery in the dark room  where mr  thomson handed the plate holder to his operator  to develope in our presence  the operator admitted that this was the same plate he had placed in that plate holder a few minutes before  and that it was there just as he placed it  he applied the necessary chemicals generally used by photographers to develope the plate only these and nothing more  and on presenting the negative to the light the out  lines of five human faces were  and are now  distinctly impressed upon the negative  in addition to the face of the sitter  these are the facts and the result of our in  vestigation  and we lay them before your readers as they occurred in our presence  respectfully  h  f  bungardt  we  the undersigned members of the committee and spectators present at the time of taking the photograph as above stated  having carefully perused the foregoing statement of the proceedings  acknowledge the same to be correct in every particular  mrs  virginia j  judson  william w  judson  jacob sherman  h

what is termed a spiritualist  i deem it but just and right to state that while mrs  lizzie carter was taking spirit photographs at my gallery she prepared her plates in my presence and the presence of my operators  and over two thirds of all the plates she used were prepared and developed by myself or my operators  all in the same manner  with the same chemicals 34 ip s  st o zee zeu   as used by myself  in taking other photographs  she used the same camera and the same furniture which i use daily and which have been used at my gallery for over ten years  but on all the photographs she took appeared from two to eight human faces in addition to that of the sitter  i desire to further state that during the time that mrs  carter operated at my gallery  my operators and myself have frequently  without the knowledge of mrs  carter  tested in various ways her so called mediumship  by exchanging plates which she had handled and prepared from the plate holders  placing new plates prepared by ourselves  in the same  such as she had never seen or handled before  but still it did not change the result  human faces in addition to faces of sitters would appear on every photograph she took  i will further state that she has taken a number of photographs of persons  strangers to her  known to me to be not spiritualists but sceptics  still the result was the same  i have been a practical photographer for over twenty years  am well acquainted with all the details of the business  and declare there is no chemical process known by which the phenomenon such as produced by mrs  carter can be duplicated  the only observable difference i have been able to discover in her operations from other photographers during the time that she operated at my gallery is  that mrs  carter generally lays her hands on the camera when she takes the photograph  of course  myself  assisted by other experts in photography  among other experiments made  did not fail to lay our hands on the camera  stood on the same spot in the same position generally occupied by herself  but it was of no avail  the spirits would not and did not come for any or either of us  julius ploetz  photographer

following one     xy  any fellow who may he proved  to the satisfaction of the council  to have slandered any brother or sister theosophist or to have written or uttered any words calculated to injure such in any way  will be required to substantiate the charges in  volved  or failing to do so in the opinion of the majority of the council  will be invited to resign or will be expelled  as may seem good to the president in council  and the name of the person so resigning or expelled shall be published in the journal of the society  and thereafter all branches will be required to refuse fellowship to the person thus excluded from the society   this rule seems to be uncommonly selfish and worldly  coming as it does from a society professing to receive high other world teachings from himalayan regions   it leaves persons outside the society who may be slandered or injured by a theosophist  to shift for themselves  it does not harmonise with the first sentence in the first rule  namely    the theoso  phical society is formed upon the basis of an universal brotherhood of humanity   the whole edict reminds me of peter pindar s story  which runs somewhat to the effect that once upon a time old king george  looking over the palings of windsor park  saw a hungry and penniless sailor unable to get along because of his worn out wooden leg  the monarch was too economical to give any  thing to the tar  so advised him to cut a new wooden leg out of the branch of a tree  then by wise and saving afterthought  his majesty told the sailor to be careful not to cut a branch off any

spiritual phenomena at clyde  ohio      all honour  i say  to the religio philosophical journal    let spiritualists frown upon all spiritual  so called  papers  who [sic] allow them  selves to become the defenders of fraud  let spirit  ualists stand by their organs that have the courage and honesty to denounce frauds wherever found  when this is done  and certain spiritualist papers find it does

me to meet the expenses of the voyage and wish me god speed  but the editor of the banner flatly refused to do anything whatever to further the object  and those friends have withdrawn from the pro  ject because of his being down on me  and the division that would result  truly it does not pay to tell the truth  but pay or not  the truth must be spoken and these frauds discountenanced    the banner states that no paraphernalia have been taken from mrs  hull  although i am told correspondents had informed the editor to the contrary  i have seen the mask and the illusion with the gold

that the dwelling was haunt  ed  for after tearing up a floor and otherwise investigating  no clue to the disturbances could be found  an authority was evidently wanted to quiet agitated minds  and a person of due intellectual weight in the world  one fisher doherty  came one evening to settle the whole matter  says the ] craw for dsville review  indiana      it was dusk when fisher got there  just about the time for spirits to come  mrs  moore said she was sorry he had come as she had found by praying to god the spirit or devil would not come that night  while she was speaking  a distant rumbling noise  something be  tween a cyclone and a bass drum was heard    e there it comes     exclaimed mrs  moore    it struck the house with great force  knocking the chunks from the cracks in the wall  fisher began asking questions  all of which were answered    the spirit reported to be one widdis p  moore  a brother of mr  moore and a former teacher in the county  after ascertaining the object of the noise  fisher said to the spirit      will you move something          rap  rap  rap     a hat was set on the floor  and was by unseen hands  raised up and down      will you bring that hat to me       immediately it was raised from the floor and floated through the air to where fisher stood  this was the first time fisher had ever seen an object moved by an invisible power   he

astronomy at the uni  versity of leipsic  and has a world wide re  putation as a first class man of science     on the 5th may  1878  at about twenty five minutes past four  mr  slade  herr oscar von hoffnaann  and i  took our places at the table and in the sun lighted room of which a photographic copy is seen in the frontis  piece   besides a number of slates  purchased by my  self  there lay upon the table other things  among them two small cardboard boxes  in which at slade s first residence in leipsic  in december 1877 1 had put some pieces of money  and then firmly plastered it up outside with strips of paper  i had already at that time been in hopes of the removal of the enclosed pieces of money without opening the boxes  however  my friends and i were so astonished and occupied with the multi  tude of the other phenomena which happened at slade s first and second visits to leipsic  november and december 1877   that i abandoned the above mentioned experiment for the time  and postponed it till slade s return to leipsic  one of these boxes was in form circular  and within it was a large piece of money   this box was firmly fastened by a strip of paper  the breadth of which corresponded to the height of the box  and its length much exceeded the circuit of the box   6ee frontispiece to transcendental physics  ed  so  indeed  that first the strip of paper was spread with liquid glue on one side over its whole length and breadth  and was then stuck several  times round the box  so that the latter  after the fastening  presented the appearance of a low cylinder of pasteboard  the other box was rect  angular  of the same sort as those in which steel pens are kept  in this box i had put two small pieces of money  and had then closed it by sticking a strip of paper round it  perpendicularly to its length  by means of liquid glue  as mentioned above  i had already  in december  1877  fastened up these boxes  and as i had observed neither the value of the enclosed coins nor their date  i could afterwards only ascertain by the noise from shaking the boxes  that enclosed in the circular one was a large ger  man coin  a thaler or a five mark piece   in the rectan  gular one two smaller coins  whether these were pennies  groschen  or five groschen pieces i had  after the lapse of half a year  at the time of slade s last stay in leipsic  entirely forgotten  after we had taken our places at the card table on the above mentioned day in the manner described  i took up the round box  and satisfied myself  by shaking  of the presence of the coin i had enclosed in it  herr o  von hoffmann did the same  and lastly mr  slade  who asked us for what purpose i had designed this box  i explained my purpose in a few words  and at the same time declared that it would be one of the finest confirma  tions of the reality of the fourth dimension if his invisi  ble intelligent beings succeeded in removing that coin from the box without opening it  slade  ready  as always  to conform to my wish  took in the usual manner one of the slates which lay at hand  laid a morsel of slate  pencil upon it  indeed  as it happened  a considerably larger one than usual   and held the slate with his right hand half under the table  we heard writing  and when the slate was drawn out  there was found upon it the re  quest to lay a second piece of pencil on the slate  which was done  then slade  who sat at my left  von hoff  mann was on my right   held the slate with the two bits of pencil again under the table  while he as well as we awaited intently what should come there  meanwhile the two fastened up boxes lay untouched on about the middle of the table  some minutes passed without any  thing happening  when slade gazed fixedly in a particu  lar direction in the corner of the room  and at the same time said  quite astonished  but slowly  the words dragged after one another  and partly with repetition     i see  seefunfand eighteen hundred seventy six   neither slade nor we knew what that could mean  and both herr 0  von hoffmann and myself remarked almost simultane  ously that  at any rate    funf   signified  funf    five   and made the sum of the addition 5  1876  1881  while i threw out this remark half in jest  we heard a hard object fall on the slate  which slade during all the time had held under the table with his right hand  the left lying before us on the table   the slate was im  mediately drawn out  and on it was found the five mark piece with the date 1876  naturally i forthwith snatched up the pasteboard box standing before me  and which during all the foregoing had been touched by nobody  to ascertain  by shaking  the absence of the piece of money which had been in it half an hour before  and behold   it was quite empty and silent  the box was robbed of its contents in the shape of the five mark piece  as may be supposed  dur pleasure at such an unhoped  for success of our experiment was extremely great  all 38 ip s it o 331 e   the more  that by it at the same time was established the existence of a direct perception of objects  not effected in the ordinary way of our sense perceptions  moreover  it could not be any so called thought read  ing by the medium  that is  the perception of representa  tions already in the heads of human beings  for neither i  and much less mr  slade and herr von hoffmann  knew what sort of coin there was in the box  nor what date it bore  i was so satisfied with the success of this experiment under such stringent conditions that i was thinking of putting an end to the sitting  and postponing further attempts to a later one  however  slade remarked that he did not feel himself at all exhausted by the sitting  which had lasted at most ten minutes  this remark of slade caused us to keep our places at the card table  and to engage in unconstrained conversation with him  i introduced the subject of his sitting with the grand duke constantine of russia  and requested him to give us a detailed account of the phenomena which took place at it  as hitherto we had seen only the brief para  graph statement about them in the press  thus urged  slade mentioned that a very remarkable experiment in slate writing had succeeded in the presence of the g rand duke constantine  accidentally there had been two bits of pencil on the slate  when he held it under the table the writing of two pencils was heard at the same time  and when he drew out the slate the one pencil had written from left to right  the other  at the same time  from right to left  i at once proposed to try whether this experiment would succeed also with us   the sugges  tion arose from me quite naturally  from the association of ideas elicited by the two bits of pencil which had been required in the above mentioned experiment  without our having as yet known the object of this written demand  slade  at once ready to comply with my wish  held the slate with the two bits of pencil under the table  surface  and we soon heard  very clearly  writing upon it  when the slate was withdrawn there was on it a com  munication in english as follows    10 pfennig 1876  2 pfennig 1875  let this be proof to you of clairvoyance  after the nine days you must rest  or it will harm you and the medium  believe in me  your friend   we at once referred the first part of this message to the two coins contained in the rectangular box still un  opened  i was just about to open it  we having immedi  ately before convinced ourselves by shaking the box and the distinct jingling within it  of the presence of the two smaller coins  yet without knowing the value or date of them  suddenly  however  i changed my intention  and set the little box again uninjured on the middle of the table  while as well herr von hoffmann as also slade suggested the possibility that perhaps the two coins  in like manner as shortly before the five mark piece  might fall from the unopened box upon the slate held under  neath  immediately upon this suggestion  slade again held an empty slate under the middle of the table  scarcely was this done  when we distinctly heard two coins drop down on the surface of the slate  and on closer examination  the above statements on the slate we  in fact  found confirmed  highly delighted  i now seized the still closed box in the confident expectation that it would  like the round box  be empty  and that  therefore  on shaking no rattling within would be heard  how great was my surprise when nevertheless the rattling happened  proceeding  indeed  likewise from two bodies  which yet  judging from the altered character of the sound could not be coins  already i was intending to convince myself of the contents of the box by opening it  which could not be done without tearing the strips of paper pasted over it  when slade prepared to get our question answered  as usual in such cases  through slate  writing by his   spirits   scarcely had he taken a slate with a fragment of pencil lying upon it  and held it half under the table  when we distinctly heard writing  upon the upper surface of the slate was written in english    the two slate pencils are in the box   in fact the two larger pieces of slate pencil were no  where to be found  and when i now opened the box by tearing the strip of paper glued to it  there within it  to our delight  were both the pieces of pencil  the fcregoing facts are of great value in a threefold aspect  first  there is proved the occurrence of writing under thfr influence of slade  the purport of which was necessarily unknown to him before  if is consequently impossible that these writings occur under the influence of the conscious will of slade  whatever modus operandi is presupposed  secondly  the apparent so called passage through matter is proved in a highly elegant and compendious manner  in order to reach by the shortest way the surface of the slate  the coins must apparently have penetrated not only the walls of the box  but also about 20 millimetres thickness of the oak table  the two slate pencils must have travelled the same way in a reverse direction from the surface of the slate  thirdly  by these experiments an incontrovertible proof is afforded of the reality of so called clairvoyance  and that in a double way  the first time  with the five  mark piece  the contents of the closed box appeared in the form of a definite represented image in slade s in  tuitional life   he   saw   the numbers 5 and 1876  the second time this was not the case  but the contents were communicated to us in the form of written characters on the slate  the contents of this rectangular box must therefore have existed as imaged in another  not a three  dimensionally incorporated intelligence  before that represented image could be transmitted to us by the aid of writing  hereby is proved  as it seems to me  in a very cogent manner the existence of intelligent beings  invisible to us  and of their active participation in our experiments   i     i  extracts from a letter by mrs  heurtley  the following are extracts from a private letter to an acquaintance in the north of england  written by mrs  heurtley  whose cruel experiences within the last two years are so well known among spiritualists   extracts from a private letter of march  1882  by j  h       from my earliest recollection i have been consci  ous of a dominant yearning after an unknown   heavenly   light  born of parents possessing exceptionally refined views of life and  although holding the unitarian faith  of unshackled religious feeling the earliest initiations they imparted to my brother and myself in moral and religious conceptions  were derived from a rigid daily discipline  fs itqih  ie   39 of the   old school   of filial obedience and of habits of respect and regard for others  feelings before consulting our own  beyond the rudimentary knowledge imparted to us concerning the existence of an all wise grod pervading nature  and creating all things  and who witnessed every  thing no bias whatever was given to our young minds  and thus we were free to receive those impressions which subsequently grew upon our convictions  as our years gradually developed the fruits of reflection  albeit though by far different methods in each of our minds   our father was reserved and somewhat unapproachable by young timid natures   but of our mother   what shall i say to convey even a faint idea of the majestic beauty of her mind and character   she was much occupied in the duties involved by her influence over a brilliant and intellectual society  amongst whom she was greatly loved  there was a peculiar charm attached to her magnetic power of attracting  by the wisdom of her converse and by her clear seeing judgment  unfortunately we saw but comparatively little of this gifted and high souled mother  but all unknown to her or anyone else the eager spirit of a little child used to ponder on every thought of original and unsectarian form which she gave birth to in language  and these early reflections were the basis of all future aspirations after the   something better than she had known     i was educated at home under a good but narrow  minded governess  and studied hard at all the usual   accomplishments   allowed no companions   for our mother disliked the free and easy ways of modern youth   i consequently had full opportunities for cultivating my innate desire for sequestered meditation  the inner consciousness of being often surrounded by a particular   presence   as i called it  grew with my growth  in my ignorance i knew not what it was  but dared to venture to believe for myself  that invisible and intelligent witnesses were around us  and i supposed they might be ethereal   angel guardians   this i kept to myself  lest someone might ridicule my   hallucinations   and thus deprive the precious hope of its reality  thus  my childhood blossomed into maidenhood   still with the one passion haunting my heart the seeking to find the key to the spiritual secret of life  what it is   and what its highest object   what are we   and what really becomes of our conscious being after death    c    c  it was to this end that i begged to be allowed to search and study all kinds of metaphysical  religious and philo  sophical works  and through these i waded as through a winding stream  but i discovered that i was still as far off as ever from touching the hey of my goal       all this time i knew nothing of spiritualistic teachings  when my mother died i was abroad  then  came to me her visible   presence   and  although quite awake  yet i found myself by her side somehow  and in a lovely garden  lighted neither by sun  nor moon  nor stars   and the light was softly bright  making the foliage and flowers to shine like gems  i heard her tell me    my child l they will tell you i am dead  but it is not so  i thought i had died  but found myself gazing on my own dead body  and still  that i was more alive than ever          tell everyone that there is no death   only change   imagine the effect of these words upon one who had so long sought for an assurance  beyond that derived from mere tradition  of this all satisfying fact  and it was this incident that turned my attention to cahagnet s works  and subsequently to hearken to the trance messages given through fletcher s remarkable mediumship thus you may perhaps be enabled to comprehend easier  the real  unselfish motive for my extreme eagerness at catching hold of the first examples of practical 11 spiritualistic  teachings presented to me  amid a thousand other misconceptions of my character actions and motives  which have been industriously spread abroad is that of my having   suddenly rushed into  spiritualism       caught  by a few spirit messages and a few fawning promises of encouraging aid in my re  searches on the subject       personally i bear no resentful feeling against the fletchers  though they only know how deeply they have sinned against her who desired only to have been their benefactress  juliet heurtley  the demise of professoe zollner  at the time of our going to press the sad news has reached london of the departure from this life of herr zollner  professor of astronomy at leipsic university  aged forty  eight  by his fearlessness of popular pre  judices and the nobility with which he fought for the cause of spiritualism he has won un  dying fame  and he passes from our midst

it may be interesting to study the sphygmographic tracings of one of those sensitive individuals who possess what has been called  mesmeric power  for want of a better name  and therefore i venture to submit to the readers of psyche a set of traces taken at the end of last year with the view of practically testing the value of my psycho dynamical theory  in an instance in which i had every reason to believe that i would find data confirma  tory of my views  judging from the history of the case  as recorded by the subject himself  the gentleman in question is a man of education and high respectability  a member of one of the learned societies  and deeply interested in the subject of mes  merism or animal magnetism  which  without being at all an enthusiast  he considers has been unduly neglected by the medical profession  a playful accusation first made in a casual conversation on my introduction to him  but which i have since attempted to rebut by pointing out that where evidence  other than mere verbal assertion  of the existence of the extraordinary  is available  members ips o it ie    f the medical profession are only too glad to accept the challenge thrown down by those who are pleased to take up the position of adversaries and accuse them of wilfully shutting their eyes to the existence of the truth  on a subsequent occasion my friend asserted that he was a mesmerist and that he could influence certain people by making passes over their limbs without contact  and he went so far as to say that in a case which he brought to my notice  where rapport had been established  he was able to relieve pain and to influence from a distance  the time at which such attempts were made  being pre  viously unknown to the person operated on  accepting his words as expressing matters of fact  and knowing very well that as such experiences are common  i had no right to throw doubts on the value of the judgment he had arrived at after his repeated experience of his powers  i asked him to let me apply the sphygmograph on two separate occasions  first in the presence of the person with whom his nervous system was so easily thrown into rapport  and on the other occasion at a distance  and under circumstances which did not  through association or suggestion  tend to reproduce that state of nervous disturbance which  i presume  is an antecedent condition to the establishment of so called mesmeric rapport with more or less community of subjective impressions    this gentleman is a fine  powerful  able young man  twenty five years of age  with broad shoulders  and of a fair and florid complexion  showing the sanguine gouty temperament  he has been healthy with the exception of attacks of what he called muscular rheumatism  which attacks he found to be inversely related to the expression of mesmeric power  as this latter idea suggested a generalisation i had arrived at from the study of my hospital and other cases which presented  what appeared to me at least  the evidence of a nervous system giving out or receiving influence from another  i was the more anxious to find if the blood current would indicate in his case too  the same class of variability in the nervous control of the system co ordinated for the distribution of energy  according to plan  throughout the body  i found the same class of trace variability as that which my best cases of nervous rapport  and convalescence after rheumatic gouty attacks in nervous subjects  had given me  and i accordingly felt justified in regarding the functional nervous disturbance in the mesmerist i  v as studying  as a causal factor in the chain of events which resulted in the decided influence produced in cases in which he had operated  after all  the mystery of such psycho physical inter  actions may not be so inscrutable as not to be easily nandled by the adoption of a well chosen hypothesis under the guidance of analogy  we have to assume first a departure from the normal physiological standard in which the potential energy  introduced in the form of food  and worked up by the organism into living matter and thereby released from the rigid  formal  definition of mere externality with its empirical invariability  is per  mitted to actualize itself otherwise than as ordinary work  ordinary physiological function  or radiated heat  in which cases only the routine of healthy activity is sup  posed to be maintained  but we assume second  that this disturbance is so far conservative that when this ex  pression of actual energy is possible  the organism is relieved from the consequences of its manifestation with  in the body  in which case it should be regarded as the purely physical aspect of many diseases  the simplest of which we may put down as hysteria and its relations from the psychical aspect  and periodical or paroxysmal fever  as indicative of palpable physical disturbance  my limited experience goes to show that the class of nervous sensitives of whom i speak  suffer more from ex  haustion than from actual organic disease when the power of throwing off or externalising is not denied them  the typical expression of such conservative relief from the consequences of internal explosions is  however  best identified in the study of haemorrhagic fluxes not necessarily periodic in character  the sphygmograph here affords valuable information  that the determined expression of energy in the lump  that is to say when it is not broken up within the body so as to result in disease or degeneration  is conservative  is  i think  supported by the fact that the influence when transmitted to another  may be of a strengthening and adjusting character  consequently in place of regarding it as a radiant action exerted by one body upon another  which can only introduce us to the conception of a sum of inanimate forces  i prefer to look upon it  in the case of mesmeric action  where the influence is not purely subjective  as indicative of a flow of disembodied life stuff  which may or may not play a useful part  according as it is or is not made use of by the body of another  the analogy to transfusion of blood is here suggested  but more than mere transfusion is suggested  blood being outside  the limits of the individuality  which uses it as a source of power  the functional activity  the design plus the blood or its contained energy  is supposed to pass over in my conception  and from the standpoint of the external  the agent would be spoken of as potential  or sum of forces in combination with substantial reality  efforts  though not generally conscious  which are abortive as far as the economy of the individual is concerned   efforts being the aggregate of living forces having their formal expression in will  which are thus treated as the correlative of potential  in the world of mind   are supposed to lie at the back of so called magnetic or mesmeric expressions of energy  which  not yet dead or dissipated  may be utilized when received by the body of another  which can be thus  as it were  to some extent driven by the first  the conjoint system  so far remaining as it were a single living body  reducing the potential of the living matter to its lowest vital terms   normal heat radiation being the final outcome where mechanical or physiological work is not done  i may be pardoned for making a digression when offering a suggestion on the vexed question of the nature of the organic language  operating in the intercommuni  cations between lower animals  i do not refer to those visible external expressions of feeling and emotion  but to those deeper physical bonds  which indicate the existence of something analogous to purposive in  telligence and consciousness  i have been endeavouring to account for various physiological anomalies in the human species by the hypothesis of the complimentary action of similar parts in different individuals  the initial change due to the one being carried forward and com  pleted by the other  the conditions of organic identity  permitting selective absorption of that physical tertium quid which must be used as a link  whether it be sp oken word  flashing signal  electric vibration  or that   sensible species   which i hold to be no longer a worn out scholastic formula   since it exactly covers our present wants   but  so far as living beings are concerned  a very definite and fruitful conception  in the lower animals there may be easily supopsed to exist  naturally  that order 41  f s y a iet ie   of physiological occurrence  which in the case of man  we must  in general  regard as pathological  except in rare instances where it seems to  he the very essence of a man s nature  and the justification of his special claim to consideration  his life work merging his individuality in the race  and thereby absolving him from the im  putation of physical abnormality  the simplest proof of the validity of my statement regarding the pathological nature in man of that which in the lower animals may be a natural mode of expression  i believe lies in the fact that it cuts at the root of human freedom and free action  the power in question may be used for good  but it may also be used for evil  there are certain lines of reasoning suggested by chemico algebraical speculations that can hardly be ab  solutely fruitless ill the future  and when taken in con  nection with the theory of the groupings of elemental feeling into the things constructed for itself by a living being and thrown out into a common form in the act and fact of their recognition as objects  which would imply that according to the completeness of the chemical pro  cess accompanying any effort  so would be the nature of the system of continuity under which the external form  and consequently its contents  would manifest them  selves  we have proof positive in the case of ourselves that the functional outcome of the organ of mind is oc  casionally initiated in one brain and completed in or by another  any ordinary clairvoyant or thought reader will prove that with a little care and patience  if then the brain or other organ of mind can illustrate my pro  position  what inherent difficulty can we suppose the other organs will offer granting them proper represen  tatives   if a nervous instrument be required  we have it to our hand in the great sympathetic system of nerves which is distributed all over the body  this it has been ably argued is the instrument of the emotions  and this which is the organic sovereign within the body  i have good reason to believe holds its sway outside the limits of the same where organic interactions obtain between separate individuals  governing and regulating them  through its agency the intellectual part of animal nature is able to bridge space and reconcile the funda  mental antithesis between thought and extension  so that granting the existence of the necessary channels of communication within the body  the establishment of an organic language of a chemical nature is easily under  stood  the strongest argument in favour of this asser  tion is the fact of intercommunication between the separate organs of the same body  where often infor  mation is supplied that would be regarded as super  natural by the uninitiated  even if some difficulties of a purely mechanical nature should offer themselves through our ignorance of the details of action at a distance  we must be content at first with the general principle  re  membering that force is still the same essentially whether it show itself as stress between contiguous parts or at  traction across a void space  the biological difficulties being no more radical than those in other departments of natural science  the third assumption involved in my hypothesis amounts simply to the assertion of the fact that a body weakly or peculiarly constructed does not continue to maintain the integrity of the process of involution  whereby that which is introduced into the organism from without  has its potential energy manifested only in accordance with ihe laws of a healthy everyday ex  perience  modifiable though they may ultimately be in process of evolution  through which changed surroundings exert a pressure which is responded to by a correspond  ing expression of vital energies  this assumption asserts that without violation of established generalities there may appear that which  though the terms and laws of the ordinary may not seem to cover it  yet may be grasped in a proper interpretation of natural operations through the removal of formal limitation  it indirectly asserts that that which is real and true for one is so for all  that as all external nature is given us in terms of the stand  ing rules of our own organisms  any inscrutable change in nature as perceived must have somewhere a con  structive as well as a percipient system correlative there  with   and that consequently all individuals being similarly related to nature as percipients  a change in one carries with it a change in all  the only difference between the manifestation of the extraordinary and that of the ordinary by any given individual  consists in the fact that in the former case the machinery is more con  cealed than in the latter  which distinction  however  is more superficial than real  the event itself alone being grten and not the causal determination  the fourth and final assumption upon which my hypo  thesis for the theoretical explanation of mesmerism   c    c    c   rests  is  that it is only through living matter that the spirit manifests its latent potentialities   that is to say  that i can no more conceive the possibility of such manifestation through fibrous tissue or bone  than i can through the dry leg of a deal table   so that when any object appears to be used as an instrument of ex  pression we must recognise it merely as symbolic of the real change  for we must remember that such an instru  ment is simply an object  which apart from perception is for us non existent  but which when perceived has corres  ponding to it change in living matter  which under the magic of the senses and the understanding is the essential basis of the real in space  as perceived  so that it is in the fundamental groupings and not in their translation that the disturbing cause is to be sought  and where  no contradiction can be introduced by the commingling of heterogeneous elements  for protoplasm is the objective aspect of moving and advancing spiritual essence  whereas dead or fixed matter is the objective crystallisation of the same  living matter being the only avenue through which spirit can phenomenally exhibit its workings to conscious  ness  it is for us a gate to be jealously guarded so that through the perfect harmony of our bodily parts our individualities may be preserved  new truth will be the outcome of psychological re  search  and even if matter of fact of the nature of foolish  ness be presented to the physicist  he can provisionally reconcile all difficulties by a negative application of the formula natura sana in corpore sano  for  giving the disturbed individual the credit of the limited disturbance in external nature  he can investigate at his ease until he is content to believe that that which was before an ap  parent contradiction in the order of nature  was only a manifestation of a more general condition of vitality  or a manifestation of vital activity under less restrained methods of manifestation  animal magnetism  commonly called mesmerism  is a legitimate subject for the investigation of physiologist or physician  and in the hope of helping even a very little in a great study i have offered these remarks  but with diffidence and caution  figure 1 represents the first tracing taken from the 42  ps y chie   right wrist of the mesmeric sensitive mentioned above  the spring of the sphygmograph indicating a pressure of three ounces  it will be seen that the character of the latter part of the curve changes rather suddenly  the fig  1  dicrotic nature of the pulse becoming less marked  the first part of the tracing shows the quick pulse and marked impulse due to the short jerking contraction of the ventricle with abrupt expansion of the ventricle  this is a pulse i have seen in convalescence after simple con tinued fever  and indicates weakness  with imperfect control through the vagus or inhibitory nerve of the heart  in the latter half of  the tracing the ventricular expansion is fuller and steadier  but the pulse is de  cidedly that of the nervous subject  i have seen this class of curve often in those who showed indications of peculiar psychical powers and susceptibilities such as planchette writing and sympathetic interactions  no  2  taken immediately after no  1  and with the same pressure on the artery  shows the heart again in an irritable jerking state  probably caused by the excite  ment antecedent to the effort to quicken the rate of the fig  2  pulse  under the action of the will  which my patient undertook to accomplish  and which the sphygmograph proved to be within his power  as the second half of the tracing was not taken until after the effort was made   the vertical line showing where the clockwork of the sphygmograph was stopped so as to compare the two in  dications  here again it is the latter part of each curve that has been curtailed  thus showing that the time of the expansion of the ventricle had been shortened  it ap  pears to me that this result was brought about by the arrest of the inhibitory power of the vagus nerve which regu  lates the rate of the diastolic change  thus giving the left side of tbe heart time to fill completely before the sys  tolic movement  which is indicated by the first part of the curve  takes place  the heart being released from the control of its inhibitory nerve  would expand more quickly under the influence of its own proper ganglia  the concentration of voluntary     effort taking place through the sympathetic system  it is as well to be cautious in the use of the word   voluntary   since the effect produced may have been the consequence of the emotional accompaniments of the voluntary effort  but it must be remembered also  that individuals have shown themselves to be possessed of a voluntary power of arresting the heart s action  and also that the muscular structure of the heart is similar to that of the voluntary muscular system  that is to say  its fibres are of the striped variety though said to be   involuntary   in function  the nervous supply being from the sympathetic system  we are not therefore warranted in denying the statement that in this instance the heart was to some ex  tent under the control of the will  no  3  taken immediately after no  2  and with the same pressure of spring  3 oz  troy  was traced while in the kneeling position  and its indications are instructive  it will be seen that in many respects it resembles the two former  but it is to be understood that the rapid action of the heart with the short expansion line  is not now fig  3  due to any voluntary or emotional excitement  but purely to the reflex due to the pressure on the patella or knee  cap tendon which in some way  through the spinal cord  throws the vagus out of control  and in this instance pro  duces the same effect exactly as if the patient were under the influence of nitrite of amyl  in fact i have in my collection an amyl tracing  taken in the horizontal position from a man with a nervous system similar in many respects  which is almost a facsimile of the one here presented  this effect of the kneeling position in the case of nervous sensitives  i discovered experimentally  my attention having been called by a patient to the palpitation brought on by kneeling  and it is valuable as throwing light upon those cases in which the presence or absence of the so  called  patella reflex   is used as a diagnostic mark  this discovery i regard as valuable in many ways  for instance  it helps to show what may be a real physical adjunct in the production of the ecstatic state in the case of prayer  in those of a highly nervous temperament  as in the instance of saint theresa  whose life history was one series of extraordinary chapters  containing much that is related to the marvellous and which has now become the object of physical and psychological research  fig  4 is a tracing taken from the left wrist at the same sitting and with the same pressure of spring  the adjustments having been carefully made so as to obtain as exact a result as possible  the heart was then fig  4  steadier  though still quick  it will be seen that the part of the curve containing the primary wavelets  differs in form from the corresponding part of the right tracings  the trace was taken in the sitting position  fig  5  a right hand tracing  pressure 4oz   was taken two days afterwards  when the subject had been sitting fig  5  for some time with the person from whom fig  6 was taken  and who was of a temperament in many respects similar to that i was studying  it appears highly pro  bable that there was set up a physical interaction between the nerve centres in the case of these two persons  so that the directing plan of blood distribution was more or less related  it will be seen that in no  5 tracing there was considerable delay in the diastolic or expansion 43 movement of the heart  and that therefore the vagus nerve was exerting its special influence in full force  fig  6  one of the beats shows a prolongation of the time of diastole of the heart  this being often the case in subjects with gouty tendency  fig  7 gives a left trace  pressure 3^oz   taken on the same occasion  the distinctive part of the curve differs fig  7  that the two sides of the central distributing apparatus in the medulla oblongata were not identically deter  mined  this difference of the two sides has been so very frequently observed by me  that i am not prepared to regard it as essentially indicative of mischief  but rather of the manifestation of the mode of operation of a mechan  ism  the secrets of which may not be beyond the limits of patient investigation  it is  however  a very common accompaniment of the nervous temperament  and very frequently met with in young soldiers  motion is the last word of physics  and the most general notions lying at the basis of the symbolic expres  sion of its production  involve the idea of two sidedness  more than that even  as in the case of waves of light of the sum of instruments right handed and left handed in character  the magnitude of these instruments being in general unequal  but in certain limiting and indeterminate cases equal  if  therefore  we start with the acknow  ledged fact that in the extraordinary manifestations of energy by certain nervous subjects  there is simply a more general expression of motion involved  it will be necessary to postulate a symbolic machinery more general in its character than that which functions in the mani  festation of the ordinary  and  as a natural consequence  we must seek for something in physical correspondence with the generalised conception  spring breezes  by j  a  campbell  b a    send forth

society for psyhcical re  search  with an early proof of the prospectus of the society  and the following particulars are extracted from its contents    it has been widely felt that the present is an opportune time for making an organised and systematic attempt to investigate that large group of debateable phenomena designated by such terms as mesmeric  psychical  and spiritualistic  from the recorded testimony of many competent witnesses  past and present  in  cluding observations recently made by scientific men of eminence in various countries  there appears to be  amidst much illusion and deception  an important body of remarkable phenomena  which are primd facie inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis  and which  if incontestably established  would be of the highest possible value  the task of examining such residual phe  nomena has often been undertaken by in  dividual effort  but never hitherto by a scientific society organised on a sufficiently broad basis  as a preliminary step towards this end  a conference was held in london  on january 6th  1882  and a society for psychical research was projected  the society was definitely constituted on feb  ruary 20th  1882  and its council  then ap  pointed  have sketched out a programme for future work  the following subjects have been entrusted to special committees   1  an examination of the nature and extent of any influence which may be exerted by one mind upon another  apart from any generally recognised mode of perception  2  the study of hypnotism  and the forms of so called ip s  st o ie   44 mesmeric trance  with its alleged insensibility  to pain  clairvoyance and other allied phenomena  3  a critical revision of reichenbach s researches with certain organisations called   sensitive   and an enquiry whether such organisations possess any power of perception beyond a highly exalted sensi  bility of the recognised sensory organs  4  a careful investigation of any reports  resting on strong testimony  regarding apparitions at the moment of death  or otherwise  or regarding dis  turbances in houses reputed to be haunted  5  an enquiry into the various physical phenomena commonly called spiritualistic   with an attempt to discover their causes and general laws  6  the collection and collation of existing materials bearing on the history of these subjects  the aim of the society will be to approach these various problems without prejudice or prepossession of any kind  and in the same spirit of exact and unimpassioned enquiry which has enabled science to solve so many problems  once not less obscure nor less hotly debated  the founders of this society fully recognise the exceptional difficulties which surround this branch of research  but they nevertheless hope that by patient and syste  matic effort some results of permanent value may he attained  the society for psychical research is now in a position to invite the adhesion of mem  bers  it is desirable to quote here a pre  liminary rote  which appears on the first page of the society s constitution  note  to prevent misconception  it is here ex  pressly stated that membership of this society does not imply the acceptance of any particular ex  planation of the phenomena investigated  nor any belief as to the operation  in the physical world  of forces other than those recognised by physical science  the council desire to conduct their investi  gations as far as possible through private channels  and they invite communications from any person  whether intending to join the society or not  who may be disposed to favour them with a record of experiences  or with suggestions for enquiry or experiment  such communications will he treated  if desired  as private and confidential  letters relating
