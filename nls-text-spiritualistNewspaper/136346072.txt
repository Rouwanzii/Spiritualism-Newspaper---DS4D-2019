LONDON, FRIDAY, JUNE 7th, 1878.
THE LONDON DAILY NEWSPAPERS.
A few days ago Mr. Gladstone pointed out, in one of his
letters, that the provincial daily press is more trustworthy
than that of London ; and such has been the experience of
Spiritualists. In the country, the daily newspapers of several
towns report psychological meetings fairly, and do not
overwhelm the experimental investigators of one of the
domains of nature with unlimited misrepresentation and
abuse. It is true that of late the metropolitan press
has been to a considerable extent silenced in relation to
Spiritualism, but that arises from necessity, since psychic
phenomena now occur nightly so regularly in so many
private families, that if a newspaper arrived next morning
saying that the facts were not facts, the editor would
simply write himself down as an inaccurate person, and for
ever destroy his influence in that particular household. The
reason why provincial daily newspapers are more trustworthy
is, that in provincial towns everybody knows everybody else,
and if a newspaper indulged in uncontrolled abusive license,
the editor and his subordinates would hear of it wherever
they went, and could not escape social ostracism. In London
the men are more out of sight, and an article which carries
great weight as the opinion of the Daily , would
lose all its influence if the readers were to remark,
as they would in a country town—a Oh! That is the
opinion of X., the drunken barrister. What a pity the
proprietors do not incur the expense of engaging a respect¬
able man to write their leaders.” Thus the same article
would have less influence in the provinces than in London,
because in the first case the writer would be well known and
accurately weighed in the balance, instead of lost in a mist
of anonymity. The London local government boards exer¬
cise great powers and disburse large amounts of capital,
yet are not so strictly under the eyes of the public as the
members of a small country town council. In fact, the
position of London in relation to its public men and its
newspapers is exceptional, and most of the London daily
papers, as compared with those of the provinces, are deficient
in a character.”
Truth is bending its attention to this subject, and points
out that a large London daily newspaper, conducted on the
present scale, involves a minimum outlay of £180,000 a
year. This is a bar to competition; and, in addition, the
practical and other knowledge necessary to successfully
battle with the multiform conditions essential to establishing
new daily papers in London, are as difficult to find as the
money, if not more so. But these impediments' are not
insuperable, especially when the present newspaper pro¬
prietors supply so much to Spiritualists and others, which
the readers have no desire to buy. We know from practical
experience in daily newspaper editing and managing that
new daily metropolitan journals can be successfully estab¬
lished on much less than the minimum sum which Truth
supposes to be necessary.
A daily newspaper usually “ writes down” to the average
level and to popular prejudices, even when its conductors
know better, but that is no reason why every new subject
should be overwhelmed with vulgar abuse. The present
journals would be considerably improved and protected
from additional competition, if every man who wrote for
them put his name and address to his articles ; the pro¬
prietors would then be forced to engage none but respectable
men, and each individual would write under a greater sense
of responsibility. The tendency of the age is to abolish
anonymous journalism ; The Nineteenth Century, Nature,
The Academy, The Contemporary Review, and journals which
deal with the most advanced phases of human knowledge,
discourage anonymous writers. Spiritualists know who pens
the editorial articles in this journal, and the other contribu¬
tions generally have names and addresses appended. In the
past generation, persecution for thinking freely in print was
so great that there was some excuse for anonymity, but that
shield is no longer necessary except as a cover for reckless
license. A strong feeling is spreading that it is necessary to
put moral checks on some of the London daily newspapers,
and the more this feeling is encouraged, the sooner will the
supply meet the demand.
SPIRITUALISM AND THE CHURCHES.*
BY EUGENE CROWELL, M.D.
In all charity I object to the strictly orthodox faith, in
that it requires us to believe that God is jealous and
vindictive, ever seeking cause of offence in erring mortals,
and being “ angry with the sinner every day;” with partiality
awarding happiness to the few, while consigning to endless
misery the greater portion of mankind.
Contrary to this, we believe that God is all love and good¬
ness, and is ever solicitous for the welfare of all His
creatures, and that He has made full and perfect provision
for the eternal happiness of all mankind.
We object, in that it represents man as naturally vile and
degraded, and unworthy of the kindly notice and care of
God ; elevating abject humility into a virtue, and presenting
the hope of reward and the fear of punishment as the chief
incentives to a virtuous life.
Differently from this we contend that we are sons and
daughters of God; that each possesses a portion of the
divine spirit, and that the nobility of our nature, our kin¬
ship to Deity, and our high destiny, should constantly be
kept in view as the most powerful incentives to noble
exertion and pure living.
We object, in that it teaches that faith in creeds and
dogmas is, as a means of salvation, of superior efficacy to
the practice of benevolence, charity, and love of mankind.
Differently from this, we believe that all creeds and dogmas
are in their results obstacles to the spiritual, and even moral
improvement of the race, and that good and pure intentions
and good works alone are both necessary and sufficient.
We object, in that it fosters a spirit of intolerance towards
others who differ from us in opinions, and claims the ex¬
clusive possession of the light u that lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.”
We object, that through its teachings millions have been,
and millions now are, deprived of the great happiness arising
| from the consoling belief in the presence and ministry of
I their spirit-friends—otherwise angels—as taught throughout
I the Bible.
We object, in that it requires us to believe that heaven is
| a far distant, uncertain, almost mythical place, where equally
| mythical beings exist, restricted in their freedom, and con-
| demned to occupations that can only meet the morbid desires
| of the perverted nature of a devotee; a purely imaginary
and unnatural condition ; while the longing desire of every
I healthy-minded, intelligent being, is for nature perfected.
We object, that it upholds the pernicious doctrine that an
| infamous life may be atoned for by the simple confession of
i its sinfulness, and a formal profession of reliance upon the
j merits of another, thus deluding the sinner with the false
| hope that he can with ease and certainty escape the just
penalty that inevitably attaches to his sins.
. And lastly, for having taught that death is a punishment
for sin, and surrounding it with an atmosphere of horror and
gloom, when it really is the means of release from earthly
ills and suffering to all mankind. Instead of being the
King of Terrors, it is really a bright angel of mercy, the

THE SPIRITUALIST.
June 7, 1878.
best friend of man, and next to life itself, the most precious
gift from the hand of Deity.
Herein is the Christianity of most of the churches different
from modern Spiritualism, and as I verily believe equally
different from Primitive Christianity; and it is a remarkable
fact, to which I desire to call the attention of the clergy,
that during the past fifty years, while the doctrine of eternal
punishment and belief in the sanguinary character of God
have been fading from men’s minds, until now but com¬
paratively few have faith in them, men have, in the same
time, and in an inverse ratio, gained faith in human nature ;
and have learned in a large degree to view their fellow-men
as brothers; and have earnestly sought the means to benefit
each other socially, politically, and morally—until, at the
present time, there is such a development of the spirit of
benevolence, charity, and justice toward the masses as no
other age has witnessed; and yet this is, par excellence, a
material, unbelieving age.
DOGMAS versus SPIRITUAL knowledge.
‘ The vital mistake of the Church has been in the expendi¬
ture of so much time, labour, and means in building up and
cementing an ecclesiastical system—one in which dogmas
and abstract doctrines have usurped the place of spiritual
knowledge—and in the discussion and expounding of which
its best talent has been worse than wasted. Faith and
doctrine have been elevated above good works and pure
living, and it has degenerated into a rigid system of dogmas,
when it should have been the embodiment of practical love
and charity. The material elements have invaded and
mingled with the spiritual until they have extinguished the
latter; and to-day, viewing the two grand divisions of
Christianity—Roman and Protestant—as a whole, only faint
indications of the spirit and power which characterised the
apostles and early Christians can be perceived. That perfect
love which casteth out fear, that love of the neighbour
which Jesus so emphatically insists upon, that noble charity
which He taught men to exercise, even to preferring the
welfare of others to their own, is it more often found in the
Church than out of it ? Have the efforts of the Church in
times past been directed to do unto others as we would have
them do unto lis, relieving the necessities of the poor, sup¬
plying them with work, seeing that they were properly paid
for their labour, standing between them and oppression,
educating them in useful, practical knowledge, and enforcing
upon those above them the necessity and virtue of regarding
all below them with eyes of charity and love ?
If instead of employing all the machinery of-Christendom
in maintaining its ecclesiastical system, if instead of con¬
centrating nearly all its attention upon itself, modern
Christianity had been one-half as earnest in its endeavours
to ameliorate the material, intellectual, and moral conditions
of mankind, it would have attracted the people Of all nations
to its embrace. Had its love went forth as that of the
mother to her children, all the secular powers of the earth
could not have restrained their subjects from rushing to her
arms, as the steel to the magnet. It is this gushing sym¬
pathy, this out-flow of love for all mankind that Jesus
laboured to make us comprehend through His life and teach¬
ings, and which being the characteristic of every true
Christian, should equally characterise the Church itself. If
the motives and actions of all Christians were inspired by
these virtues, their combined influence through the Church,
as a channel of communication with the outward world,
would overshadow, as with a glowing, moral atmosphere,
the minds of men; and religious, moral, and intellectual
knowledge would advance side by side, and the welfare and
happiness of all would be insured.
But there need be no anxiety about the future of Christi¬
anity; all that is good and true therein is eternal, and
although the truth is at present overgrown by the weeds of
error engendered by human imperfection, yet the stimulus
which the spiritual elements have in our age received is even
now quickening these elements into increased activity, and
giving promise of an abundant harvest in the not distant
future. Notwithstanding the hostile attitude which the
Church now sustains towards Spiritualism, all the labours
of its votaries, all its truths, are destined to be appropriated
by the Church itself, and through the light it is bringing
into the latter, the weeds and tares that haye for so long a
I | period overspread the fields of Christian labour will wither
| I and decay.
! ( | SPIRITUAL INTERCOURSE A BULWARK OP THE CHURCH.
| ! Could the Protestant clergy and laity see with the pro-
111 phetic eye, they would perceive that every convert who
| I swells the rank of Spiritualism is only an additional element
||l of future strength to the Church, when it comes to recog-
| | nise the predominance of the spiritual over the material.
! | Once admit that we have the truth, so far as the simple
! | fact of spirit intercourse is concerned, and it follows that
| the Church, sooner or later, will be compelled to adopt it.
| With this fundamental truth acknowledged in the Church,
( there must of necessity prevail a great diversity of opinions
I upon the associated and minor questions of Spiritualism as
II now prevails amongst Spiritualists, and wherein will you
11 then differ from us—only in the advantages you will possess
| of distinct organisations, of an established ministry, and of
) temples already erected in which to worship, and in which
the truths of Spiritualism will be taught.
| Spiritualism is not destined to have a permanent efficient
j organisation of its own, and just as fast as you accept and
| teach the basic truths of our faith and philosophy, Spirit-
| ualists will be irresistibly drawn to the churches in which
| they or their fathers worshipped, in which so many of their
11 dearest friends gather, and where they find their belief not
11 only treated with respect, but sustained and expounded from
II the pulpit.

III the mantle of self-sufficiency, who are content with their
| present light, and impatient of the toleration of new ideas,
| should be able to perceive the steady yet rapid progress
| which this new light and these new ideas are making in the
I Church itself, but the most indifferent, if at all discerning,
| are aware of the important changes of opinion which have
| occurred in relation to the dogmas really or nominally held.
| How few, comparatively, now believe in that cherished old
dogma of a burning hell for the impenitent sinner, and how
j little we now hear said of the sinner being consigned to any
! form of eternal punishment. Why do we hear so little of
j God’s vengeance, and so much of his love and mercy ? Why
j so little of the saving efficacy of faith alone, and so much
| of the necessity of gooff works ? It is because of the better
| knowledge prevailing of the legitimate requirements of the
! true Christian life, and to Spiritualism you are largely
|| indebted for this increased measure of light you now enjoy,
| and it is to Spiritualism the Church will be indebted for
further light.

J ) THE SPIRITUAL ELEMENT IN THE ROMISH CHURCH.
While the Romish Church, as before said, has always
recognised the spiritual element, and made ample provision
for the requirements of its votaries in respect to it, the
Protestant Church has eliminated nearly all that is vital and
spiritual from its belief and teachings, and from being
| | directly arrayed against materialism, it has steadily, though
| | to itself unconsciously, imbibed materialistic ideas and
| j views until its practice and belief have become pervaded by
J | them, and ail it possessed of spiritual Christianity has
| become obscured, and it is to-day a question whether it is
a self-existing organisation, actuated by its own inherent
vitality and force, or dependent upon scientific materialism
for direction and support.
The Romish Church is a comprehensive organisation in
| which the Spiritualism of the Bible, though misunderstood,
is not only authoritatively upheld, but the claim confidently
' made that it has been perpetuated in the Church, and that
its manifestations are constantly occurring under superior
|i direction, in proof of the divine authority upon which the
< Church is supposed to rest. With this element of super-
! sensualism in the Church, which so strongly appeals to the
j spiritual natures of its adherents, we find united an elaborate
i | and imposing ceremonial which with equal force appeals to
| the senses, so that where the spiritual demands of men are
| predominant they here find ample provision, and where
' I sensuous requirements predominate, equal provision is made
;! for these.
i1 THE POSITION OF PROTESTANTISM.
j The Protestant churches in this respect, instead of pre*
senting one compact effective organisation, are divided into
June 7,187&.
THE SPIKITTJALIST.
267
sects, each claiming a larger endowment of spirituality than
the other, and yet not one professing to believe in the
possibility of a spirit manifestation to-day as it occurred in
the times of Jesus and His disciples. Like the Komish, the
Protestant Church believes in miracles that happened
eighteen centuries since, but unlike the Eomish Church, it
repudiates all faith in similar miracles to-day, and while
the Catholic refers to present miracles in proof of the verity
of those upon which his faith is founded, the Protestant
closes his eyes and declares that these are all delusive and
false; but with strange inconsistency he at the same time
refers with confidence to those that occurred in a semi-
barbarous age, based upon testimony which would be rejected
in our courts of law, and then is surprised that all do not
see like him, and at once, adopt his belief.
Thus the Protestant Church, when approached by the
spiritually starved—and millions are in this condition—
from the depths of whose natures arises an overpowering
demand for spiritual aliment, has nothing to offer—or at
best nothing but husks—which, if devoured, so far from
appeasing hunger, only produce spiritual indigestion, in¬
quietude, and repugnance to like food in the future; and
how can it be otherwise when we know that spiritual hunger
can only be satisfied with spiritual food, and it is folly to
expect to furnish spiritual grain from an empty granary.
If the Protestant Church is not able to meet the spiritual j
necessities of mankind, neither is it successful in its efforts |
to attract by its externals — through the sensuous and
emotional natures of men. This weak side of Protestantism
is so apparent that arguments and words are not necessary
to prove it, but it is weakness only in connection with the
sad deficiency of spiritual strength. Were Protestantism in j
possession of this, no ceremonial, no ritual, no saint nor fast j
days would be necessary as reminders to those of weak faith, j
The simplicity of the early Christian worship was no obstacle j
to gaining converts. The miracles, or spiritual manifesta¬
tions that accompanied Jesus and his disciples, together with
the example of their pure lives, and the force of their
inspired teachings, fell with power upon the minds of men,
and irresistibly attracted them to the Christian fold.
Thus we perceive that the Protestantism of to-day is
destitute of the spirituality of the Romish Church, as well as
of the imposing ceremonial which in this Church is so
effective in impressing the imagination, and holding captive
the uninstructed mind. The Primitive Christian Church
we find characterised by great spirituality, and by equally
great simplicity. How does the Protestant Church compare
here ? Remarkably well as to simplicity of form, but as
regards spirituality it is at direct variance with the Primi¬
tive. We therefore find that in the two great sources of j
strength in the Romish Church, Protestantism is utterly
lacking, and that of the two principal sources of strength in |
the Primitive Church, the Protestant Church can only lay |
claim to one, and that the least important.
Simplicity such as prevails in most Protestant Churches,
is only compatible with highly developed spirituality. United
their power is irresistible; but there is no instance known of j
any religious sect or body, which at its commencement clearly j
possessed spiritual power, and which was remarkable for j
simplicity of form of worship, ever being successful in making
converts after its spirituality had departed, and while retain¬
ing its simplicity of worship. With the flight of the angel j
there must be introduced the vestments of the priest, the !
decorated altar, the perfumed incense, and the sensuous
music.
It was thus with the early Christians, it was thus with the
Methodists who mesmerised multitudes through their spiritual |
force and simple form of worship, but who to day are j
stationary, their numbers, especially in the large cities, not j
increasing in the ratio of population, for the reason that
while their original form of worship remains, they have lost j
living. faith in spiritual forces, and have set their faces . j
against them. The Friends, or Quakers, are in a similar |
condition, and for precisely similar reasons, and these
reasons also apply to the whole Protestant Church. In one j
denomination, the Episcopal, and among certain members of
this Church, both in America and England, a movement is
in existence looking to the adoption by that Church of
many forms and ceremonies similar to those prevailing in 1
| the Romish Church. This is a legitimate movement, and
| proceeds from what may be termed an instinctive desire in
the Church to escape from its simplicity of forms, as it
! already has from its spiritual influences. This is the in-
j stinct of self-preservation, and it is equally strong in bodies
I of men as in individuals, and for this reason the present
j movement bids fair to operate with increasing force, and if
| successful, and if the progress of Spiritualism does not avert
| it, it will probably be followed by other denominations which
I now give no sign of such tendency.
Protestantism to-day finds itself pressed between the upper
I and nether millstones of materialism and Catholicism. Each
| of these powers is bearing upon it with increasing force, and
I it must assimilate and incorporate within itself one or other
| of these, or itself be ground to powder. In its present condi-
| tion it lacks the necessary strength and vitality to resist the
action of these forces, and its only hope is in the fresh blood
which Spiritualism alone is able to infuse into its exhausted
veins. That it is part of the mission of Spiritualism to
accomplish this task, I fully believe, and this belief is
founded upon the palpable needs of Protestantism, and a clear
conception of the adaptability of Spiritualism to the task, and
its ability to perform it.
The ranks of modern Spiritualism have from its advent
j been mainly recruited from the Protestant churches, and
| from the fields of materialism, and when these churches cast
off the dingy garments of error which now deform them, and
reappear in the spotless robes of Christian spirituality, all
j who now are, together with all those who hereafter will be
arrayed under the banner of Spiritualism, will gravitate to
reformed Protestantism, and she will then gather the
harvest we are now planting, not one of her children will be
i lost to her, but multitudes who now wander over the desolate
j wastes of materialism, together with many who are enter-
| ing our ranks from the camp of Romish superstition, will
j with them arrange themselves under the banner of the only
j Church which tolerates, though sometimes grudgingly, the
I expression of free opinions, and through which liberty and
science have their present full and free existence. Then will
] be fulfilled the promise :—“ For the Lord has chosen Zion,
He has desired it for his habitation. This is My rest for ever;
| here will I dwell, for I have desired it. I will abundantly
| bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread; I will
| also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall
| shout for joy.,>—Ps. cxxxii. 13-16.
“ This is the Lord’s doing—it is marvellous in our eyes.”
SWEDENBORGIANISM.
This article will close with the advisory remarks of Rev.
B. F. Barrett, to those of the clergy who are reading Sweden¬
borg. They are equally applicable to those who are investi-
I gating Spiritualism. The study of the writings of Sweden¬
borg is an excellent preparation for orthodox investigations
| of our philosophy, as Swedenborgianism is the vestibule of
| modern Spiritualism.
“ My advice, then, to every minister who is reading with
j interest the writings of Swedenborg is : Make no change in
your outward church relations. Remain steadfastly at your
post, and preach what you believe to be God’s truth in an
earnest, charitable, and loving spirit, yet with judgment and
discretion. Let alone the old and still existing errors,
and preach the new truths affirmatively. And proclaim
them in the spirit of truth—not with sharp angles or rough
edges, as if you meant to rend or wound; but so rounded
and softened by the oil of love, that they shall easily win
their way to the hearts of your people. Pursue this course,
and you will find that ere long the errors, without any direct
assault upon them, will gradually give way before the new
truths, as the dead leaves of autumn are pushed off by vital
forces of the buds beneath. And so, at last, your people will
feel that there has, indeed, been to you, and through you to
them, a new advent of the Lord, ‘ with power and great glory.*
I will further add, by the way of encouragement, that there
are several interested readers of Swedenborg among ‘the
ministers of the Methodist, Baptist, Unitarian, Congrega¬
tional, and Episcopal Churches (some of them quite eminent)
who have for years been pursuing the very course I advise;
and I have never heard that a single one of them has looked
upon his course as unwise or mistaken, or felt himself
hampered in his freedom or hindered in his usefulness.”

THE SPIRITUALIST.

A PROPOSAL TO CIRCULATE “ PSYCHOGRAPHT.”
BY C. 0. MASSEY.
I beg to offer a suggestion which, if acted upon, will, I
believe, tend to further public appreciation of the evidences
of Spiritualism. I have distributed some few copies of
M. A. Oxon’s Psyckography, and have been agreeably sur¬
prised at the effect it has produced on the minds of the
recipients—always persons who had no previous knowledge
of the subject, or indeed interest in it. In this little book
we possess for the first time just what is required to arrest
the attention of educated people who will neither glance
at a Spiritualist newspaper, nor take the trouble to plunge
into the general literature of the subject. Spirit People
was excellent; but it was the single testimony of the writer,
and it ranged over a variety of phenomena which had nothing
of novel interest for the public. “ Another book on table¬
turning ” is too likely to be contemptuously tossed aside.
And I do not suggest that Psychography is going to convert
the world, or to make society put on sackcloth and ashes for
its treatment of Dr. Slade. We can but prepare the soil
and sow the.seed, which may remain long underground.
But this book, if widely distributed, will be widely read.
We have not yet tried the costly experiment of presenting
books to the public. Newspapers have been sent abroad,
and no doubt in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred have
been pitched promptly into the waste paper basket.
People do not treat books in this way. The recipient may
laugh or fling it down, but it is suffered to lie on the table
for a season, and if one member of the family is too busy,
too apathetic, or too prejudiced to read, another is not. And
to read a few pages of Psychography is to satisfy oneself that
it is the work of a scholar, of a gentleman, and of a sensible
man. It is well bound, prettily got up, and has the not
unimportant advantage of a title which excites curiosity
without immediately encountering prejudice. Could we not
send, say one hundred copies, into houses where it will at
least be seen by large and influential numbers ? We must*
recognise social facts, even if we do not greatly esteem
them. And as a mere matter of fact, to lodge an idea or a
fact in the mind of a lord, is to give it a better chance of
fructifying in the world than to lodge it in the mind of a trades¬
man of equal intelligence. I see occasional sneers at would-
be fashionable Spiritualism. It would be as reasonable to
taunt the great Church of Rome for exulting more over the
conversion of a Marquis of Bute—or of any other person
widely loved and respected-in a particular circle—than over
the conversion of a mere social unit, without influence or
other adventitious importance. There is another cap which
has been painted in unpleasant colours of reproach, and which
fits me in particular so exactly that I must needs wear it.
It is the questionable adornment of those who brought down
upon the movement the prosecution of Dr. Slade by presum¬
ing to challenge men of science to an investigation which it
was weakly supposed would be bond jide. You, sir, never weary
of adding little admonitory daubs to that cap, whose penal
feathers also wave in testimony of exceptional agreement
with another quarter whence censure also comes. I, for one,
am impenitent, but I am not proposing to repeat the offence.
We will let “ scientists ” (the barbarous but convenient I
word seems to have established itself now in this country) !
alone for the present. If we can spread our u epidemic |
delusion ” among the influential classes, it is the next best I
thing. I should prefer Huxley and Tyndall to the whole j
peerage for comparative and rapid effect. But Huxley j
and Tyndall will only laugh at us till it is their turn to be j
laughed at. And I quite agree that progress cannot be j
“ forced.” But we can place our evidences where they can be i
seen by those who have eyes to see; Psychography in only a j
hundred drawing rooms will assuredly do something. I will |
subscribe for a dozen copies, if the hundred can be made up.
Then let one of the Committees of our Association decide to j
whom they shall be sent. It is only a small operation, but
we are propagandists, and should never let a year or a season
pass without attempting something in proportion to our |
means, which are unfortunately quite inadequate at present j
to any v( ry costly measures for extending information.

WEIGHING MEDIUMS DURING SEANCES*
BY WILLIAM H. HARRISON.
The Research Committee of the British National Associa¬
tion of Spiritualists recently commenced its high work of
original investigation in the domain of spiritual pheno¬
mena, by ascertaining approximately what variations take
place in the weight of a medium during the evolution of
strong physical manifestations, and has obtained results
which redound to the credit of this Association, and demon¬
strate the solid advantages conferred upon the movement by
orderly organisation to carry out the principle of friendly
union among Spiritualists. I have been honoured with an
invitation to broadly state the general results this evening,
in order that they may be freely criticised, and will do so
with some brevity, because nearly all here present have seen
the details in print.
A cabinet was mounted on a weighing machine, in order
that, as the weight of the medium in the cabinet varied
during manifestations, those variations might be recorded.
The record was made automatically upon a band of paper
round a vertical drum (Fig. 1), revolving by clockwork in
the direction denoted by the arrow. The pencil W moves
up and down in accordance with the variations in the
weight upon the machine, and as the
cylinder is also in motion, zigzag
lines upon the paper are the result.
The line A B represents the weight of
. -r the cabinet, the line B D that of the
/ITT medium, or an indicated weight of 158
lbs.; his actual weight may be a few
pounds more or less, but such varia¬
tion being a constant does not affect
the scientific value of the results. As
the seance goes on, the weight of the
medium falls, and is subject to con¬
siderable fluctuations.
The following diagram (Fig. -2) shows broadly the
general results deducible from the few seances already
held under the conditions just stated. In this cut the
^ 
_D
R
Fig. 1.
line N N represents sixty minutes of time, and the line
W N the 158 lbs. weight of the medium. During a materiali¬
sation seance his weight gradually falls to between 30 lbs.
and 35 lbs. between B and D, and towards the close of the
stance his weight is sometimes recovered in three sudden
instalments, represented between D and E.
During the common manifestations of a dark seance,
such as the floating and playing of musical instruments,
the weight of the medium does not sink so much as during
a materialisation seance; it sinks only to K K (Fig. 2),
instead of to B D.
The lines K K and the lines B D are not of the same
nature. K K (Fig. 2) is of the nature represented by A B
(Fig. 3); and B D (Fig. 2) of the nature represented by
DE (Fig. 3). During a strong dark stance the body'of a
powerful physical medium is of but about half its normal
weight, and subject to momentary fluctuations of several
pounds each.
Mr. C. E. Williams was the medium, and during
the only strong materialisation seance held with him
while he was on the weighing apparatus, his body gradu¬
ally sank to less than one-fourth its normal weight,
and lay as a motionless mass in the cabinet. When

the spirits returned to this mass to “take on more j
of the mortal,” it slowly increased in weight, as represented j
at F (Fig. 3), but fell suddenly when they left it again, as !
represented at H. Each time they left it, it was a pound |
or two less in weight than before, as indicated by the |
dotted lines (Fig. 3).
Unfortunately the seances of Mr. Williams are always
held in total darkness, except at the moments the mate- j
rialised forms produce their own lights. Therefore the j
records of the phenomena and the times of their occurrence
are noted by one of the members of the committee, who j
takes his seat in a spare cabinet, so that the light by which j
he works is enclosed with him, and does not interfere with j
the dark seance outside. On one occasion Mr. Joad and j
myself were the only witnesses present, and as I wished to !
see the manifestations instead of being shut up in a .cabinet j
taking notes, I obtained the permission of Mr. Williams
and the spirits to use a weak phosphorescent light in the
room now and then, to see the time by my watch, and to
make the record. In the early days of my investigation of
spiritual phenomena, I tried various experiments in the
artificial moving of tables and production of imitation spirit
lights in order to be better able,.from actual practical
knowledge, to form an opinion whether alleged manifesta¬
tions observed at seances came from an earthly or spiritual
source. Hence I was able to produce a light sufficiently
like a “John King” light in intensity, size, and colour, to
be allowed to use it as already stated. If you will darken
the room I will show it you.
The light is produced by allowing common air to mix
with vapour of phosphorus, in a bottle of a particular shape
and size.
The full details of the stances with Mr. Williams, accom¬
panied by facsimiles of the diagrams drawn by the self-
recording apparatus, were published in The Spiritualist of
May 3rd and May 17th, so I do not think it necessary to go
farther into those details now. Miss Kislingbury kindly
volunteered to copy the diagrams on a large scale for the
Research Committee; these excellent copies, which have
been made at much expenditure of time and labour, are now
displayed upon the walls of this room, and I hope they will j
be framed and preserved as a memento of the first fruits of !
original research conducted under the auspices of this Asso¬
ciation.
These results are of special value in that they bring the |
physical phenomena of Spiritualism more within the range
and order of previously acquired human knowledge. The
law of the conservation of energy is that power is never |
lost; it can be transformed, or stored up, but not anni- |
hilated. The waves of light coming from the sun “ unburn ”
some of the small proportion of carbonic acid in the air,
and the now unburnt carbon is stored up in ears of wheat,
and other products of the vegetable world. Man eats the j
wheat, and the slow burning of the carbon in the muscles j
and every part of his body gives him the power to do work, j
to raise a hammer, and to strike a nail upon an anvil. Is j
the power then lost ? No. The previously cold nail is hot, j
because of the blow ; the mechanical motion of the hammer j
is changed partly into the molecular motion of heat, and
partly into waves of sound ; for the noise of the blow speeds i!
through the air, the anvil vibrates slightly, and so does the j'
ground on which it stands, and air, and anvil, and nail, and j
hammer are all more or less raised in temperature by the
vibrations. The power expended in lifting a weight from the I
floor to the top of the table is not lost; much of it is stored
up in the weight, for in its new position it possesses the I
power to perform work ; for instance, to turn the wheels of I
a clock in the room, which it could not do while it was upon
the floor. In short, of late years it has been proved that
force, like matter (using those words in their ordinary and
not their metaphysical sense), can neither be created j
nor destroyed. Hence one of the strongest mental
objections of physicists to psychic phenomena is that,
in their opinion, the law of the conservation of energy
would be broken if the facts were true—that is to say, f
if they read that a chest of drawers rises in the air at one j;
end of a room while a medium is sitting at the other, they j i
look upon it as an alleged creation of force; a mechanical j J
effect is produced, without a corresponding decrease of 11
| power somewhere else. But directly we show that when
| phenomena are presented at one part of a seance-room,
weight and energy are correspondingly abstracted from
the medium, the fact is largely drawn down from the region
of miracle into the domain of law. If an object too heavy
| for the medium to lift, rises in the air without much visible
discomfort to him, it merely means that that power which may
! have been gradually drawn from him for twenty minutes, and
| stored up, is expended in one minute; or, in other words, that
j a great effect is produced in a short time, instead of weaker
| efiects throughout a long time, but the amount of energy in-
I volved is the same in both cases. Thus these weighing experi-
| ments have a potent influence in withdrawing our phenomena
| from the region of what I will call the “irrationally
| miraculous ” into the region of law. A great chasm,
perhaps the greatest chasm of all, between the physics of
spiritual phenomena and the physics of the various sciences
has been philosophically bridged over by these experiments.
After these facts are admitted by those who are now
ignorant, the nature of the power producing the effects will
long be a subject of contention. That question there is no
time to go into to-night. Suffice it to say that, while a
I medium is at one part of room, a something which is the
| double in features and appearance of that medium is, during
| genuine manifestations, going about at another, and claiming
I to be a spirit; it is nearly as much limited by the intelligence
and brain of the medium, as it is by his features and form. I
have anxiously watched for years for a living face with
flexible features, temporarily materialised off the premises of
the medium, and bearing no resemblance to the medium.
Much as I have desired this, I have never seen anything of the
kind. My idea is, that the following hypothesis is likely, in
time, to take rank as a true theory, namely:—A spirit is an
intelligence whose earthly body, or “ machine ” with which it
manifested on the plane of matter, is broken. As a general
rule it can then only manifest on the plane of matter, by
temporarily, by will-power, taking possession of more or less
of the healthy living organism of a mesmeric sensitive, or
medium, or psychic. The last name is the best, and should
be brought more into use.
Out of “ malice prepense,” as the lawyers say, and with
deliberate intention, I made no allusion to the imposture
| theory of the experiments, which theory the uninformed are
| likely to raise. In connection with other branches of know-
| ledge, writers and lecturers do not pass half their time in
| arguing whether their friends and colleagues are rogues and
! thieves, nor have I any desire to gratify the superficial and
| the ignorant by removing their objections of this kind; if
| they will not take the trouble to do so themselves, they are
| not worth converting, and it is best not to waste time in
| contention with them. But at the same time I think that
| manifestations not produced under strong test conditions,
before good witnesses, ought to be most rigidly confined to
| private life, and not published; thrusting them into print
j does more harm than good, and injures the movement, the
| testifiers, and the medium. One day, before the chief
| sitting with Mr. Williams, I tried several experiments with
j the weighing apparatus, to see what records were produced
| by my making various small and violent motions on the
| machine, also by moving about with one leg off the machine
! and another on it. Hence those who afterwards advised

| made, and the artificial diagram pasted in the book of the
| Research Committee. I did not find it practicable to arti-
i ficially produce Mr. Williams’s manifestation of April 5th,
| 1878, at 8.52^ p.m., when the spirit gave a heavy musical
| box to Miss Kislingbury, who was seated 12 ft. 3 in. from
I the front of the cabinet; while this was done there was a
| quivering weight on the machine of never less than 28 lbs.

I ten feet long, and it requires a prepossessed imagination, like
| that belonging to Dr. Carpenter, to conceive that a wicked
| medium placed among credulous people, must necessarily
I possess the power of thus slily elongating his limbs in the
| dark when he pleases. Such a theory has a true Royal
| Society flavour about it. We all know that according to

THE SPIRITUALIST,
June 7, 187§.
If Mr. Williams can elongate his limbs after this fashion, j
I should like to see him so exercising all of them in the light, j
We should no longer call him Mr. Williams, but the Human I
Octopus. Another theory is, that while cunningly manipu- I
lating weights and strings, he was capering about in white |
robes. He often obtains the manifestations in strange j
houses while held hand and foot by strangers, and it is j
easier for him and the powers about him to give real rather !
than sham manifestations, so there was no temptation' to |
produce artificial phenomena. As regards the chief seance, j
at which I was one of the observers, I trusted chiefly to my j
knowledge from long observation of the minute character- j
istics of genuine manifestations. Again, the results demanded |
by theory were obtained. As our knowledge of legitimate j
results increases, this weighing apparatus is likely to become j
a superior method of testing genuine phenomena, since par- j
ticular manifestations will be known to produce par- j
ticular diagrammatic results, which each medium placed |
upon the machine could not hope to imitate artificially. As i
our knowledge of the physiology of mediumship increases, j ]
it will be possible to ascertain what phenomena are genuine j
without recourse to rough methods of testing.
In conclusion, the following remarks about the weighing j ]
experiments, contained in a letter received by me this |
morning from M. Aksakof, of St. Petersburg, may be of J
interest:— ! j
11 The remarkable experiment with Mr. Williams in the j <
cabinet upon the weighing machine suggests the following j i
ideas to me, which I submit to your consideration. j
u It only needs one thing to render the experiment abso- i
lute—the presence of light.
f? 1. The materialisation should take place in a dark cabi- j
net on the weighing machine, with the medium placed within j
it, the rest of the room being in full light. John King might j
then float up to the top of the cabinet and touch a little bell, j
or show himself at the aperture of the cabinet, and at the j
same time the weight of the medium should be registered.
That John King can sustain himself in the air he has proved j j
to me by rising, with his lamp, up to the ceiling of the room j
at an hotel, where I saw him, in London, in the year 1875. ;
Many other people have also certified the same.
“ 2. Or the materialisation should take place in a dark j
cabinet, with the medium placed outside on the weighing j
machine, in the lighted room, and in full view of the i
observers. Here the conditions would be absolute. We !
know that materialisations do take place when the medium
is before the curtains. If then, in view of the experimenters,
the weight of the medium diminished, if only a few pounds,
we should be able to pride ourselves on having obtained
‘the grandest discovery of our age’ under indubitable
circumstances.
M Have the goodness to communicate my suggestions to I
your Research Committee, and if they find them useful and
practicable I shall be well pleased to concur in any results j
obtained under such conditions.” I
From Death to Life.—A resurrection case has just occurred iu |
this city, which has created a great sensation, and no little excitement j
among the superstitious. Several months ago Mrs. Maria Hillitz, a | j I
wealthy and highly respectable German widow, was taken ill, and, in j j
order to secure proper nursing and medical treatment for her disorder, | j
was removed to the Hospital of the Little Sisters of the Poor, in the j j
western part of the city. She continued ill for some time, and about [ j j
two weeks ago grew suddenly worse. During her illness she received j j |
the best of medical attention and tenderest nursing from the Sisters of j j j
Charity at the institution. She grew worse, however, and her physician j) i
pronounced her case hopeless. Last Saturday night she died, and on i (j
Sunday the body was shrouded and placed in a casket ready for burial 1 j j
on the following day. The corpse was laid out in the parlour of the j i
hospital, on the first floor. The friends of the deceased gathered on j j j
Sunday, and watched beside the corpse of their companion. About jjj
midnight the watchers were thunderstruck and utterly paralysed by 11
seeing the body of Mrs. Hillitz suddenly arise from the coffin, get up j j |
and stand erect with glaring eyes ; and, imbued with a superhuman ! j
energy, the woman ran up the steps to the hospital on the second floor, j | j
singing at the top of her voice. The nurses were so astonished at this j (]
unlooked-for event that they stood still and made no effort to obstruct j j j
the movements of the woman. As soon as they recovered from their ! ] j
fright they placed her in a bed, where she lingered until to-night, at ten | j i
o’clock, when she was pronounced dead by the attending physician, j j |
The affair has created intense excitement, and the hospital was visited j j j
by thousands of persons anxious to catch a glimpse of the resurrected i j j
ct i pse.—Richmond ( Va.) Despatch, i < i
CURIOUS SPECULATIONS OF BYRON’S DAUGHTER ADA.
Written in 1839, when she was twenty-four years of age.
I have long conceived life here to be only a particular
mode of action (a peculiar mode of vibration, perhaps, in
some subtle fluid akin to the electrical ether, if not identical
with it), and that death is nothing but a change in this
mode of action, in consequence of which it ceases to remain
connected with the brain, ceases to be concentrated—if I may
so speak—and consciousness becomes marvellously extended.
I wish I could truly express all I mean and feel: so vivid
and peculiar is the impression at times that I could almost
fancy I had died already. I have a glorious conception of
death. I am strongly inclined to material views of the intel¬
ligent principle. I think there is a hind and mode of exist¬
ence. of matter so very different from anything here in
evidence around us that by comparison it may be called
spiritual. But in the strictly spiritual I do not believe. I
think there is a mode of action which, when once given birth
to by our Creator (or rather under His laws), can never,
never cease. This is immortality. I call our life here a concen¬
trated life, and until our intelligence and conscience have
acquired a certain practice, it is probably necessary that
there should be this concentration of the sphere of action.
I much question whether any of the bad principles (by which
I mean those which abuse has rendered bad) can exist
except in a highly concentrated form; and therefore I should
imagine that the bad have to go through some state or
states much more akin to the present than the good have.
My metaphysical doctrines are not founded on Scripture,
but I am delighted to find that all Scripture confirms them,
in some parts very strikingly.—Trelawny's Records of Shelley
and Byron.
A general feeling is gaining ground that seances for form manifesta¬
tions, when not under test conditions, waste the time of everybody, and
do the movement more harm than good. It is time that some other
phases of psychical phenomena were more cultivated. The useful and
interesting daylight seances of Mrs. Mary Marshall’s time are now
unfortunately unknown.
Mr. J. J. Morse in Glasgow.—On Sunday next Mr. Morse will
deliver a trance address in the Spiritualists’ lecture hall, 164, Trongate,
Glasgow; subject, “ Spiritualism; Its Ultimate the Religion of
Humanityservice to commence at 6.30 p.m. On the following
(Monday) evening, Mr. Morse will deliver another trance address;
subject, “ A Rational Review of the After Life, as Taught by Spirit¬
ualism , chair to be taken at eight o’clock.
Mr. J. J. Morse, the medium, has written a letter to The Banner
of Light (Boston, U.S.), in which he stated that the British National
Association of Spiritualists is said to be about to change its name to the
Metropolitan Institute of Spiritualism. This alleged pews, which has
no foundation in fact, has been quoted in the Boston Sunday Herald as
if it were trustworthy. Mr. Morse also recently wrote to The Banner
of Light that the National Association of Spiritualists has had a falling
off in its income this year, the truth being that it has so large an
increase in its regular income in the spring of 1878, as compared with
the spring of 1877, that it only requires <£150 of special contributions,
instead of the .£250 of last year’s guarantee fund.
Mesmerism in Paris.—On the 23rd of May a dinner, followed by a
ball, was given for the first time by the Mesmeric Society of Paris,
under the presidency of M. le Baron du Potet, to celebrate the 144th
anniversary of the birth of Mesmer. About a hundred persons
assembled in the Salons Leblanc (Palais Royal); amongst them were
several distinguished mesmerists, Spiritualists, authors, doctors, and
scientific men. Speeches were made by the Baron du Potet,
M. Augerville (president of the society), M. Maille, M. H. Durville
(proprietor of the Revue Magnetique), M. Poncy, of the Geneva
Society, and others. A poem in honour of the event was read by
M. Hallimbourg, also one by Mdlle. Francine Joussen, a young
somnambulist, written under spirit influence. It is proposed
that another anniversary dinner shall be held next year. —Revue
Magnetique.
Dr. Slade.—Professor Friedrich Zdllner, in the course of a recent
article in the Psychische Studien, thus expresses himself in regard to
Dr. Slade :—“ I made other surprisingly successful experiments, which
I had worked out from my standpoint of space theory, and which
Slade himself did not believe to be possible. The appreciative and
sympathetic reader will understand what pleasure this gave me, and
how gratefully I presented Dr. Slade, ‘ in remembrance of hours spent
in Leipzig,’ with the first volume of my Principles of an Electro-
Dynamic Theory of Matter, in which I had some years previously
discussed the possibility of theories of extended space in relation to
our physical world. As Dr. Slade made on myself and my friends the
impression of being a gentleman, his conviction for deception in
London awakened our liveliest moral sympathy. For after witnessing
those physical facts which took place in his presence with such great
variety, there could be no reasonable ground for supposing that Slade
had in any single case resorted to conscious deception. Dr. Slade was,
therefore, in our eyes, innocently condemned, a sacrifice to the unin¬
formed judgment of his accuser and his judge.”

ANGEL LILY.
From Poems of Progress, given through the trance mediumship of Miss Lizzie Doten.
Of all the flowers that greet the light,
Or open ’neath the summer’s sun,
With fragrance sweet, and beauty bright,
The Lily is the fairest one,
And in its incense-cup there lies
A perfume, as from Paradise.
O, once there lived a fair, sweet child,
And Lily was her gentle name;
As beautiful and meekly mild.
As if from Heaven’s pure life she came—
A breathing psalm, a living prayer,
To make men think of worlds more fair.
O, there was sunshine in her smile,
And music in her dancing feet,
And every tender, artless wile,
Made her dear presence seem more sweet;
But ever in her childish play,
A strange, unfathomed mystery lay.
Her playmates—well, we could not see
That which our darling Lily saw—
But often in her childish glee,
She filled our loving hearts with awe,
When, pointing to the viewless air,
She told us of the Angels there.
“ O, very beautiful! ” she said,
u And very gentle are they all;
At night they watch around my bed,
And always answer to my call.
I asked to go with them one day,
But a tall angel told me nay.”
Yes—the “ tall Angel ” told her nay,
But it was only for a time ;
We knew our Lily could not stay
Long in this uncongenial clime.
Into their home of love and light
The Angels led her from our sight.
They led her from the earth away,
Into the blessed <c summer land,”
' Leaving to us her form of clay,
With budding lilies in the hand;
Ah emblem of her life, to be
Unfolded in Eternity.
O, though there falls a gloom like night
From Sorrow’s overshadowing wing,
How often does returning light
A ray of heavenly brightness bring,
And problems that were dark before
Can vex the soul with doubt no more.
Beneath the heavy cloud we stood,
Through which no ray of gladness stole,
But well we knew that Sorrow’s flood
Would cleanse and purify the soul;
And when its ministry should cease,
Our lives would blossom fair with peace.
One evening, when the summer moon
With silver radiance filled the sky,
And through the fragrant flowers of June
The balmy breeze sighed dreamily,
With spirits calm and reconciled,
We talked of our dear Angel child.
We spoke of her we loved so well,
As one who only went before—
When lo ! just where the moonlight fell
With mellow lustre on the floor,
We saw our own sweet darling stand,
With half-blown lilies in her hand.
She seemed more beautiful and fair
Than when a simple child of earth ;
The golden glory in her hair
Betokened her celestial birth ;
But as she sweetly looked and smiled,
We knew she was our own dear child.
0, strange to say we did not start,
We did not even wildly weep,
For each had schooled the wayward heart
The law of perfect peace to keep—
And deep as Love’s unfathomed sea
Had been our faith that this would he,
0, shall we tell those moments o’er—
And all her words of love repeat—
And say how, through Time’s open door
She glided in with noiseless feet ?
Nay, rather let us purely hold
Such things too sacred to be told.
Enough to say we wait our time,
With heaven’s own sunshine in the heart,
Bejoicing in the faith sublime,
That those who love can never part,
And wheresoe’er the soul may dwell,
That God will order all things well.
THE SENSATIONS OF A MEDIUM.
(From the il Religio-Philosophical Journal^)
A medium, in going through the ’process of thorough development,
which fits him for being controlled by the higher individual intelli¬
gences, is apt to experience extreme mental, and sometimes physical,
suffering, especially in the early stages of his development; and if the
organisation of the person is not an evenly balanced one, danger to the
medium is incurred during the process of development, which should
for the time be desisted from, for it often happens that eccentric and
unbalanced spirits obtain the absolute control of the medium’s organism
during the seance to the disgust of the various members of the circle, as
well as himself.
For instance, many years ago a gentleman, an unbeliever in spiritual
things, attended a sitting one evening where a number of mediums were
being developed, and in a short time was seized by an Indian spirit,
who caused him to execute a regular war dance, to the great merriment
of the other members of the circle, closing the powow rather abruptly,
however, by shooting out doors, with a terrible yell, into the dark woods
near by; and it took the members of the circle some time to get him
back into the house and into his normal condition again. None of his
friends, who are Spiritualists, have dared to invite him again to their
circles for fear of similar consequences.
It may possibly be necessary, at some period of the medium’s develop¬
ment, to have the “ dogs of war ” let loose upon him, so that he may
comprehend their power, and his spiritual band be thoroughly apprised
of the situation and temperament of their medium, and be the better
prepared to protect him from the rougher and grosser elements of the
spirit-world.
Partially developed mediums are those whose spirit bands are not
sufficiently organised, or numerically strong enough, to protect their
subjects in all cases, and such mediums are particularly cautioned from
frequenting places where murders, or violent or obscene deeds, have been
enacted, as they are liable to be seized by some sporadic, ugly
spirit lingering around such places, and severely dealt with. Especially
are gaols, insane asylums, or any institutions where bodies of un¬
balanced human beings are confined to be avoided by mediums when
in a transitory or sensitive condition. Of course, if the medium is of
an exceedingly robust constitution, and surrounded by a powerful band,
he can visit such places with impunity.
I recollect in my experience, at one time especially, when I had not
for many months felt the influence of any spirit or spirits, I chanced, in
a journey, to stop over night with my family at a friend’s residence,
and without thinking of the subject of Spiritualism, or of my mediumship,
I was seized, upon entering a certain room in the house, by the most
powerful spiritual influence I ever felt; so powerful that I seemed to be
almost raised bodily in the air, and encircled around by mesmeric
currents. I immediately placed myself in mental communication with
the spirit thus encircling me, and soon ascertained who she was—an
aged lady of exceedingly vigorous and crabbed temper while in earth-
life, and who had passed away but a few months before. As soon as
she had sufficiently impressed her identity upon me, she bade me an
affectionate farewell, and retired, leaving a soothing influence, which
pervaded the room for a long time. I was, however, conscious of my
own weakness, and dare not even to-day assert that I am anything but
a plastic instrument in the hands of a spirit, if he catches me in the
right condition and in the right place; and I feel the force of the remark
of that great man of science, Draper, “ that we may do this thing, or
abstain from doing that thing, yet over the laws of our being we have
no control; ” and one of the laws of a medium’s being is to keep aloof
from corrupting and vicious influences, or they will overcome him.

272 THE SPIRITUALIST. June 7, 1878.
AN AUTHENTIC APPARITION.
{From Dr. Sinclair’s 11 Invisible World.”)
THE APPEARANCE OP THE GHOST OF MRS. BRETTON FOR THE RECOVERY OF SOME i) j
BANDS TO THE POOR ; IN A NARRATIVE SENT TO DOCTOR MOORE FROM EDWARD |) |
FOWLER, PREBENDARY OF GLOUCESTER, AND AFTERWARDS BISHOP OF THAT i / |
DIOCESE. ] (I
Dr. Bretton, late rector of Ludgate and Deptford, living jjj
formerly in Hertfordshire, was married to the daughter of I !
Dr. S . This gentlewoman was a person of extraordi- !
nary piety, which she expressed as in her life, so at her !
death. She had a maid for whom she had a great kindness, j)
who was married to a neighbour, whose name was Alice. R
Not long after her death, as Alice was rocking her infant in !
the night, she was called from her cradle by a knocking at jj)
the door, which opening, she was surprised at the sight of a j
gentlewoman, not to be distinguished from her late mistress j
neither in person nor habit: she was in a morning-gown, jj
the same to appearance with that she had often seen her j
mistress wear. At first sight she expressed very great J
amazement, and said, “ Were not my mistress dead, i should |
not question but that you were she.” She replied,‘‘I am |
the same that was your mistress,” and took her by the j
hand, which Alice declared was as cold as a clod ; she added, jj
that she had business of great importance to employ her in, j
and that she must immediately go a little way with her. j
Alice trembled, and besought her to excuse her, and en- j
treated her very importunately to go to her master, who must j
needs be more fit to be employed: the spectre answered, j
that he who was her husband was not at all concerned, but j
yet she had a desire rather to make use of him, and in order j
thereto had several times been in his chamber, but he was j
still asleep, nor had she power to do more than once to un- j
cover his feet, towards the awakening him; and the doctor j
said he had heard walking in his chamber of a night, which j
till now he could not account for. Alice next objected, that j
her husband was gone a journey, and she had no one to look J
to her child, and that it was very apt to cry vehemently; j
and she feared, if it awaked before her return, it would cry j
itself to death, or do itself a mischief; the spectre replied, j j
the child should sleep till her return. j i
Alice seeing there was no avoiding of it, sorely against } j
her will followed her over a stile into a large field, who then j \!
said to her, Observe how much of this field I measure with j j
my feet; and when she had taken a good large leisurely j) j
compass, she said, All this belongs to the poor, it being j i
taken from them by wrongful means ; and charged her to go j j
and tell her brother, whose it was at that time, that he j j
should give it up, forthwith, as he loved her and his dear j 11
aged mother. This brother was not the person who did this n j
unjust act, but his father; she added, that she was the more ! j
concerned, because her name was made use of in some 1 j
writing that related to this land.
Alice asked her how she could satisfy her brother that this j \ j
was no cheat or delusion of her fancy 1 She replied, tell j | j
him this secret, which he knows that only himself and I am j j
privy to, and he will believe you. Alice having promised j \ j
to go on this errand, she proceeded to give her good advice, j j
and entertained her all the rest of the night with heavenly j j
and divine discourse. When twilight appeared, they heard [jj
the whistling of carters, and noise of horse-bells, whereupon j j
the spectre said, Alice, I must be seen by none but yourself; j
and then disappeared. j j
Immediately Alice made all haste home, being thoughtful 11
of her child, but found it as the spectre had said, asleep as j i
she left it. When she had dressed it, and committed it to j j
the care of a neighbour, away she went to her master, the j j
doctor, who, amazed at the account she gave him, sent her jjj
to his brother-in-law. He at first hearing Alice’s story and 1! j
message, laughed at it heartily ; but she had no sooner told j !
him the secret, but he changed his countenance, told her he j j
would give the poor their own, and accordingly did so, and j j
they now enjoy it. jj I
This, with more circumstances, had been several times .j j
related by Dr. Bretton himself, who was well known to be a j j
person of great goodness and sincerity; he gave a large j j
narrative of this apparition of his sister to my two friends, j j
first to one Mr. Needham, and afterwards (a little before his jj j
death) to Dr. Whichcot. About forty years after I received jjj
the foregoing narrative, I fell into company with three sober I {I"
persons of good rank, who all lived in the city of Hereford,
and I travelled in a stage-coach three days with them; I
related this story, but told it was done at Deptford ; for so I
presumed it was, because I knew that there Dr. Bretton
lived. They told me, as soon as I had concluded it, that the
story was very true in the main, but only I was out as to the
place, for it was not at Deptford ; but as I remember, they
told me at Pembridge, near Hereford, where the doctor was
minister before the return of the king; and they assured
me, upon their own knowledge, that to that day the poor
enjoyed the piece of ground. They added, that Mrs.
Bretton’s father could never endure to hear anything of his
daughter’s appearing after death; but would still reply, that
it was not his daughter, but the devil: so that he acknow¬
ledged something appeared in the likeness of his daughter.
This is attested by me, 17th February, 1681.

ECHOES.
Inspirational verses, given without pause, Dartmoor, May 3,1th, 1878. *
What are ye Echoes
Through the valley flying,
Where your magic notes
Ever float undying ?
How your light forms can I view,
Gliding ’mid the winding rocks,
Whence your voice forth leaping mocks
Him the caves who wanders through,
Hoping in some dim recesses
To catch ye by your floating tresses,
As ye glide before him still
Round the tree-encircled hill ?
Say where ye dwell!
Is it in some curved shell,
That repeateth evermore
It’s parent Ocean’s hollow roar ?
Is it ’mid the rugged jags
Of some thunder-splintered crags,
Where around the summits high
Ye mock the eagle’s piercing cry,
Till the sound in anger hearing,
Round the pinnacles careering,
He seeks in wrath his fancied foe
From motmtain-top to dell below ?
Ha ! I hear your voices call
O’er the sleepless waterfall,
And, receding, now they quiver
Down the many-winding river,
Wafting with them through the vale
The clear tones of the nightingale.
Stay your restless wings,
For a moment stay!
Let me see the shape that flings
Sounds so bright and gay !
' Are ye like odours,
Formless, divine ?
Can ye with the elements
Wholly entwine ?
Shaped from the sunbeams, each wind-woven frame,
The delicate bodies of Faery may shame,
Winged by sweet sounds through the tremulous air,
Ye fly across valleys, or tree-clad or bare ;
And over the moorland the wandering voice
Bids the wayfarer lost in the waste to rejoice.
Oh ! could I see ye as gaily ye float
And speed in your sporting each far ringing note,
Tossing it swiftly from valley to hill,
Or mocking the song of the hurrying rill,
I’d pine to fling from me this cumber of clay,
And shake from m»y soul the dull casing away;
A bodiless child of the mountains to bo,
And wander for ever through heaven with ye.

CURIOUS ALLEGATIONS MADE THROUGH TRANCE MEDIUMSHIP.
Sir,—On the 24th of January I was sitting with a medium. Imme¬
diately before going into trance he said, ‘ ‘ Lubeck, I feel trembling like
a leaf.” He then went into trance, and spoke as follows :—‘‘I am an
uninvited guest—unbidden—yet I am here. I am speculating to myself.
The subject matter of my speculation is what? Heinrich Christian
Heinecke; that was the name of him who was in my mind, and formed
my speculations. They consisted, first, whether what I had to say
would be believed by you; secondly, its utility. I was speculating on
the strangeness of the communication, and upon its utility if believed.
You asked me whether my name was Heinrich Christian Heinecke. I
will answer you. No and yes. I ask for your faith, and at the same
time I am in doubt whether your scepticism would in the smallest

degree irritate me. At present I think not. On earth I was a philo- 15
sopher, meeting the different changes and vicissitudes of life with calm- j <
ness—I was nearly saying indifference. I paid no obedience to any |)
moral law. As to the existence of a God, I never grasped at its feasi- j)
bility, and in earth life thoroughly denied its possibility. In the truest j j
sense of the world I was cynical instead of trustful to all I came iu j)
contact with. I am speaking of one hundred and fifty years ago. It j j
has been urged by men in the flesh, and advanced spirits too, that the ! (
after state of the spirit was a position of undeviating progression. Now, j j
I deny this; therefore my speculation, which I should wish to be \1
believed by you. I retrograded in spirit life; on the top of my many | (
sins I put a crowning one. I returned to earth again. I inhabited a |)
tenement of clay, and lived upon earth in that tenement some five and j j
a half years. I ask for your faith, and I will tell you whether scepticism j j
will irritate me. I stood by the side of the weeping father and mother, |)
over a babe whose spirit was leaving its body. The age or time of its j j
earthly experience was four days; I mean the body had been formed for ! j
the reception of a spirit four days. I saw the child’s heavenly guide j)
and guardian spirit, and as the spirit of the babe left its house, I saw its I
guide remove it in his arms, and convey it to spheres in the heavens j
nearest to God. I had seen in my experience on earth more wonderful )
phenomena in my philosophic reasoning mind than in my existence out (
of the body, therefore the wondrous fact to me was a mere fact of con- >
scious individuality out of the body, which led me no nearer to the con- j)
ception of a supreme ruling mind than did the stars which in earth life j l
I had seen and noticed, and whose motions had been one of my favourite j)
studies—whose immense distances I, with others, had calculated. To | j
sum up, I felt that the fact of the mighty moving masses of js
matter whirling in space was an infinite, onwards, and ever present fact I)
to me on earth, beside which the mere fact that I was in spirit life faded ] j
into insignificance. The one had led me no nearer to God, nor had I j
the other. I cared not for companionship in the spirit world. I longed j j
for earth’s experiences again. Unaided by prayer or petition to God, j)
I determined to choose for myself a tabernacle which I could inhabit j s
and again venture upon earth’s scenes, feeling again the passions which |
had faded but were still held. I determined to find a habitation for my j J
spirit in the body of this new born babe. In the transition state I con- j *
centrated that state in which the spirit of the child was leaving the j 1
body, before the mechanism of the physical organisation had ceased to ] <
act. I succeeded, and in this fragile habitation I, a spirit of a previous
sixty-seven years of earth’s experiences, took up my abode. My active, j
restless spirit was perfectly imprisoned in this body. I mean that it was j
ten months ere I could manifest the power of speech through it. ' I was -i
afraid of crushing the tender fibres of the brain by using them too j
roughly. At ten months I was able to talk fluently. At two years I ]
could argue with doctors of divinity from the proofs afforded by the
Hebrew writings of the prophesies respecting the coming of the Messiah.
At four years of age I was able to talk fluently English though this
body, the tongue of one of the parents of this body, and some four thou¬
sand Latin words. At that age I had entered into studies with the
greatest anatomists living. I was then enabled to meet in argument j
with the most noted divines, ignoring then the authenticity of Bible :
records at four years of age. I was too anxious to bring my talent j
forward through habitation; my architectural studies, my mathematical
exercises, performed at the age of five years and four months, were the
wonder of all the leading minds. Fluently I could answer all questions
in history. Passionately fond of astronomical studies until the brain I
formation collapsed—broke—understand me perfectly, because I am I
incapable of conveying my ideas to the outside world, as though this !
glass (taking a tumbler off the table) would be incapable of holding water
were I to control the arm holding it to dash it on the floor. The
envelope was no longer worthy to contain the spirit; I abandoned it,
having had five years and nine months a second earth life. One thing |
I was perfectly incapable of performing, and that was the power of
mastication. I lived on the nurse’s milk to the day I flung aside the
body; in other words, the body was suckled under the impression it
conveyed the spirit that was born within it I will not give my
name. I have given the name of the family through which I went
through my second life. The chances are you may find it in some
biography, as I have sat and argued when the body was two years |
old with some of the greatest minds living. I have a reason why |
I will not state my name, but I have this reason to give to j
you. The Almighty permitted me the power of reincarnation; but,
understand this perfectly, my individuality was never destroyed. I was
always what I remembered myself on earth, and no other. It was
permitted me, through God’s mercy, this second life. But for this
reincarnation state I should in the vistas of eternity never have got
out of a sphereless condition, as I never knew, cared for, nor feared a
higher power. God proved my ineffectuality of living by that particle
of mortality. By that atom from the complete whole which formed my
immortal soul, the ineffectuality, thorough and complete, of governing a
body, unaided by His unseen care and love. I found a difficulty in
every passing day; I prayed for total destruction as the end of all my
cares. Occupying this self-chosen habitation but five years and nine
months with immense difficulty and thorough incompetency, then for
the first time dawned the fact—there must be a God, because my
spirit found itself at a loss in directing the movements of a body
already formed for it. I am, perhaps, giving a seemingly inconclusive
argument for my conviction of a Supreme Being, but none can jndge
the difficulties I experienced whilst in that body—a self-conviction
gaining every hour more force that part of myself was indestructible;
that I was unwittingly going directly contrary to some Power, to some
Being’s fixed laws. This conviction of a God drew to my side for the
first time during spirit life a spirit companion. He is leading mo into
paths tha.t lead me towards this Infinite God. I have had, and philosophy
may gainsay it—I again say, I have had a century and a quarter of the j ,
greatest hopelessness. This has been part of my expiation. I am * l;
rising. Pray for me. May He in whom I now believe bless you !
Pray for me.”
It certainly must be allowed that this was a very extraordinary con¬
trol. I have had one or two controls who have asserted the fact of
having had more than one earth’s experience, and other controls have
contradicted and told me it was all imagination on the part of the con¬
trolling spirit. Having no biographical dictionary containing any
reference to Heinrich Christian Heinecke, a few days ago I called in at
a' bookseller’s shop where I deal, and asked for a biographical dictionary.
He handed me a volume of Knight's Encyclopedia, where, under the
title of “Heinecce,” I found a description of a precocious youth
answering fully to the description given by the control. The most
singular part of my story is this—that within a couple of hours after I
read the account in Knight's Encyclopedia I had a seance, and the very
first words used were H. C. Heinecke. A. T. T. P.

MR. WILLIAM HOWITr’S “DOCUMENTARY AND IRREFUTABLE PROOF.”
Sir,—My attention has just been called to a letter in the Medium
of the 17th of May last, in which Mr. Howitt does me the honour of
putting me in the witness-box in support of his statements, that we
“ set out with ostracising Christianity, and embracing every other
species of spirit faith ”—that we “ denounced Christianity; put on our
records the renunciation of all sympathy with Christianity,” and
“ called on our members to renounce all sympathy with Christianity.”
As I am excluded from the columns of the Medium, I must appeal to
you, sir, to kindly insert my reply.
I must decline the honour of the imputation conveyed. All that I
said, according to Mr. Howitt himself, was that we had expunged a
clause proclaiming our sympathy with Christianity. If this admission
of mine be,-as Mr. Howitt alleges, identical with his assertions, or
even affords them the feeblest support, then indeed “ there is no mean¬
ing in words,” or rather, there is too much, for any one word means
just the same as any other.
Doubtless Mr. Howitt does not intentionally mis-state, or misrepre¬
sent, facts ; but there evidently exists in his mind an extraordinary
confusion of ideas, and an incapacity for distinguishing between the
meaning of one word and another, or even between one fact and
another, which is infinitely more ridiculous than ignorance of a
commonplace fact of literature or of history.
It is self-evident why Mr. Howitt sought the columns of the
Medium, though anti-Christian, and also why his letter found such
ready admission there, though so Christian. Mr. Howitt supposed
that no reply would have been allowed to appear (nor would it, unless
the defence of the Association had been more than compensated for
by the attack on yourself, contained in Mr. Rogers’ letter),' and the
editor of the Medium is only too glad to insert any attack on the
Association, but still more so any attack on you, sir. A. Joy.
Junior U.S. Club, 4th June, 1878.
[We wish this subject, in which principles and personalities have been mixed,
to be dropped, except the placing on record whether Mr. Howitt hereafter tells
the readers of the Christian World the truth about the point on which he has
misinformed them, or whether he thinks it in accordance with his religious
principles, that his original utterance shall stand historically on record uncontra¬
dicted, endorsed, as it is, by his signature. An aggressor in literature is as bad
as an aggressor in war, for attacks sometimes necessitate defence, with the pro¬
duction of bad feeling and tumult; hence Spiritualists should always make the
position of wanton aggressors socially unpleasant and so much to their detriment
in private life, that the results of their irreligious conduct do not come before the
public.—Ed.]
SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA IN BIRMINGHAM.
Sir,—As you have kindly published that we held a benefit seance in
connection with our Society, on Tuesday last, I should like herein to
briefly state what took place. After,all the sitters had assembled, an

inspection of the room was made by them ; the medium, Mr. John
Summerfield, was placed under the inverted sack provided, and its
edges were then securely nailed down to the floor. The sitters all
joined hands, and the light had hardly been put out when a bell, tube,
and fan began to move, although they had been placed some distance
from the cabinet and the sitters. We then turned up the light and
found the medium still nailed down, but inside the sack were found
many beautiful flowers. The light having been again put out, the bell
rang all over the room; a musical box (which had been placed in the
room unknown to the medium) was played, although the owner had
the key in his pocket. A harmonium was played by two hands, and a
violin was struck ; all these things were played upon and moved about
the room at one time ; the sitters felt spirit hands, and heard the direct
spirit voice in different parts of the room. A glass of water was raised
in the air and passed through the sack to the medium ; all heard the
water being drunk; then the glass was handed by the spirit to a
sitter; it was found to be scented, and the perfume filled the whole
room. All the time these manifestations were going on, the medium
was moving his feet in the sack cabinet, and, to crown all, he was
brought out of the cabinet, as we suppose, through the top, which was
covered with paper; we heard the paper burst and the medium drop.
When the light was turned up, the nails at the bottom of the sack
were found intact, and the medium outside. There will be a special
service on Wednesday, June 19th, under test conditions.

ST. ANTONY OP PADUA.
To the Editor of “ The Tablet.”
Sir,—In my letter concerning the new mission at Anerley, which
you kindly published on the 16th ult., I mentioned my intention of
placing it under the invocation of St. Antony of Padua, but, not to
trespass unduly upon your space, deferred some remarks I should wish
to make on the peculiar power of his intercession in recovering things j
which have been lost.
Let me begin by relating a wonderful instance which has occurred to
me within the last few days. I lost a pretty rosary, which had been |
given to me as a present from Rome, and, as I have since discovered, it
was picked up in my garden by a vagrant who had come round to the
back door selling flowers. This was on Saturday last, and as the
woman got clear off with her booty, I will ask those who are sceptical
about the power of the Saint, to consider ■whether it was likely he could
compel her to bring it back. I must confess that if I had known she
had taken the rosary, I should have thought the case so hopeless that
it would almost amount to presumption to ask St. Antony to get it i
back for me ; but, having no such suspicions, I had no doubt that he !
could find it. Well, to my great amazement, on Monday morning back
came the woman with the rosary, openly confessing that she had picked j
it up in the garden and walked off with it! *
Those who are acquainted with the life of St. Antony will not be
surprised to find that he can now do in heaven what he could do on j
earth. * Eat as some of your readers may not know to what I am j
alluding, I will quote the following lines from the Chronicle of St.
Antony of Padua, edited by F. Coleridge St. Antony had lost his
manuscript; 5 it was stolen by a novice, who escaped with it from the
monastery. Antony was not long before he missed it, and he prayed
earnestly that it might be recovered. It has been remarked that it was
the only time when he, who was to be the great finder of lost things in
after ages, asked a grace of the kind for himself. It was, as we should
expect, granted. The novice related how he was just going to cross a
bridge, when there suddenly rose up before him a man of savage coun- I
tenance barring the way, threatening him with a drawn sword, and
sternly commanding him to restore the book. He instantly turned
back to the monastery, and, throwing himself at St. Antony’s feet,
begged his forgiveness with many tears.” Another account tells, us ji
more explicitly that on this occasion St. Antony remembered the words
of our Lord, “ Whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall
receive,” and obtained the favour by his perfect confidence in God.
Here we have the rationale of the practice of invoking St. Antony, j
We all believe the words of our Lord, but when we come to ask for
temporal favours we find our faith wavering, so that we cannot claim
the fulfilment of His promise. But it is not difficult to say to St.
Antony, “ You have perfect faith, therefore if you ask for me I cannot I
doubt that I shall receive, otherwise our Lord’s promise would be made
void.” And the great advantage of this practice is, that when we
constantly see the fulfilment of our Lord’s promise, through St. Antony’s
faith in it, we find our own faith in the goodness of God, who “ knows
how to give good things to them that ask him,” continually increased. I
Confidence in God is so great a necessity for so many of us, whose
faith is continually dulled by associating with unbelievers, that I think
the practice of invoking St. Antony is sure to supply a great want, and
prove of immense benefit to those who will adopt it, not so much in j
view of the temporal advantages which will result from it as of the
spiritual benefits which will accrue from an increase of faith and con¬
fidence in the goodness of God.
For this reason I earnestly recommend every one to adopt it, and, as
I said in my former letter, they would do well to begin by making a i
little offering to St. Antony’s new mission at Anerley.—I remain, Sir,
yours sincerely in Christ,

(I In the silence of eve when the shadows were falling,
51 And the rocks in the twilight grew pallid and grey,
{| I gazed on a castle once famous in story,
(j And thought upon those who had long passed away.
(i Round the ivy-clad turrets the sea-birds were screaming,
) i And the torrents beneath in their murmuring flow,
S | Sighed a sorrowful dirge, ’mid the gloom and the darkness,
11 O’er the graves of the mighty ones sleeping below.
) ] I gazed on the moat with its cold icy water,
) | On the courtyard and terrace with nettles o’ergrown;
s j Through each dark winding passage my footsteps re-echoed,
) \ And I silently mused as I wandered alone.
( The rack and the dungeon, the chain and the fetter,
) Have long done the work of oppression and wrong;
I But their dark reign of terror has vanished for ever,
For the truth has prevailed o’er the power of the strong.
II Oh, beautiful ruin, a moral thou teachest:
Thy dark desolation, thy dust and decay,
Are but emblems and types of tyrannical ages,
Which are fading full fast, and must soon pass away.
I wish not to see thee again in thy splendour
Of pomp and magnificence—fleeting as sand—
O’er the race of humanity freedom is dawning,
And a happier time for mankind is at hand.
Of the nations of earth the foundations are shaking,
For purposes, deeper than mortal can tell,
Are working and weaving with men and their passions.
And ruling the universe wisely and well.

THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CHURCH OF
SCOTLAND.
With the prescribed accompaniment of ceremonial, the sittings of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland were opened a few days
ago in Edinburgh. A long procession of soldiers, police, bands, and
provosts and magistrates in their robes of office, started from Holy-
rood to the High Church in Edinburgh, escorting the Lord High Com¬
missioner and the Countess of Rosslyn. In the church the retiring
Moderator, the Yery Rev. Dr. Phin, preached from Timothy, chap, ii.,
verses 3 and 4, and in the course of his remarks made an ignorant attack
upon Spiritualism, reported as follows in The Scotsman newspaper:—
“ They saw many professing Christians committing themselves to the
guidance of one religious instructor after another, under the influence
of no fixed principle, but simply from a desire to discover a teacher who
would either justify or palliate the evil habits to which they were prone,
and would explain away certain portions of Scripture against which
their carnal minds revolted. Those who were to act in the manner
described in the text were to have * itching ears.’ The expression
obviously implied that the persons spoken of were to insist upon being
pleased or agreeably excited by what they heard. Were not ‘itching
ears ’ too common in their own time ? Did they not find many nominal
Christians attracted to propagators of doctrine diametrically opposed to
Scripture by the interesting, or, as many even said, amusing form in
which the doctrine was set forth ? Let the language of a man who
affected the position of a religious teacher be eloquent or flowery, his
statements have a semblance of novelty, his mode of reasoning appear
profound (because scarcely intelligible), and not a few Christians would
admire and approve of his conduct, and exult in him as an authority in
behalf of doctrine to which they were determined to adhere, though they
knew it to be prohibited by the Word of God. Another of the predictions
mentioned in the text was that these men were to ‘ turn away their ears
from the truth.’ They had among their contemporaries men notorious
not merely as sceptics, but as industrious propagators of scepticism,
after having passed through each stage described by the Apostle. Once
more, his text foretold that the men referred to in it would be ‘ turned
unto fables.’ Even at present, while the much-vaunted nineteenth cen¬
tury was drawing to a close, the grossest fables were abroad among an
educated, class—men who once called themselves Christians, but would
not endure sound doctrine, and had fallen into the snare of arrant
impostors, and been persuaded to believe in alleged communications
with the other world as absurd as the wildest fancies of the lunatic. In
closing, Dr. Phin said the progress of error in churches was generally
both silent and slow. Let not ‘ fathers and brethren ’ permit themselves
to depart, however slightly, from the Scriptural creed which their godly
and learned predecessors in the ministry and ruling eldership embodied
in those doctrinal standards which were accepted by the State as syste¬
matic expressions of the truth which the Church was established to
teach, and to which, so long as she did not renounce her position as an
Establishment, she was bound by covenant to adhere. Let them be
impressed with the conviction that the ‘ Church of the living God is the
pillar and ground of the truth,’ and that if their Church were to cease
to be so (which God forbid) she would prove worse than useless. Let
them feel that they could not too jealously watch over the purity of doc¬
trine by which the Church of Scotland had ever been distinguished. Be
it theirs individually to seek in earnest prayer, not merely for a specu¬
lative belief, but for a living and saving faith in the Divine Word, and in
Christ who was its grand theme.”

THE SPIRITUALIST.
275
SPIRITUALISM IN AUSTRALIA.* • \ I
BY EMMA UAKDINGE BRITTEN.
Twenty-nine days of changeful and weary voyaging brought us at
last to that paradise of unmatched scenic beauty, Sydney Harbour.
HeTe the ship had scarcely touched the shore ere two of the best of
spiritual friends, Messrs. Henry Gale and Phillippi, were on board,
giving us cordial welcome, prompt to assist us in landing, help us to
find accommodation, and return to visit us in the evening, with a party
of friends no less warm-hearted than themselves, headed by that j
noblest, most consistent, and faithful of all trans-Pacific veterans in the
spiritual ranks, the Hon. J. Bowie Wilson. My heart leaps again as
I write the honoured names of my dear Sydney friends, and recall to
mind the many more yet unrecorded, yet none the less true and grate¬
fully remembered. I had heard much of Melbourne, at which city my
only recognised engagement was to be fulfilled, but nothing of Sydney
as a spiritual centre ; I had been assured that all the spiritual life and |
progress of which Australia could boast would be found concentrated
in Melbourne, whilst all the fogeyism and conservatism which Spirit¬
ualism had most to dread would be found in equal force concentred in !
Sydney.
The truth of these reports, as far at least as Sydney is concerned,
may be gathered from the fact that whereas I simply intended to
remain there for a three days’ rest after my long voyage, I was com- j
pelled by the noble band of friends who came to greet me on my j
arrival to remain with them for three weeks, and in two lectures each
Sunday, and two more delivered on every succeeding Tuesday and
Friday, I found steadily-increasing audiences, growing at last into j
larger throngs than the theatre could accommodate, together with
demonstrations of intelligent appreciation and personal kindness which i
make my memories of Sydney, its large audiences and warm-hearted
friends, amongst the most agreeable of my entire public career. Having |
only just left this scene of spiritual interest and triumph, and lectured |
once in Melbourne, after a few days residence in the city, I am unpre¬
pared to say how far rumour has played me false in respect to the one j
city or the other. More of this anon.
The Victorian Association of Spiritualists, with Mr. Terry, the well- i
known and enterprising editor of the Harbinger of Light, at its head,
gave me a most kindly welcome at its place of meeting the second
night after my arrival. A very large audience assembled to hear me in
the Opera House on Sunday night, and cheered me heartily at the |
close of the lecture and questions, and if I can but get sufficient oppor¬
tunities to make acquaintance with the Melbourne public, I have little j
doubt I shall be compensated for my long and arduous voyage of seven
thousand miles, though there seem to be but one or two places where a
spiritual lecturer can find a field of effort.
Australia is a very large place, larger, in fact, than the whole of the
United States of America, but the disabilities attending its first settle¬
ment, and many intricacies and involvements peculiar to a colonial
status, so completely paralyse its chances of rapid progress or unity
with the great Spiritualistic movement of America and Europe, that I
am assured I shall not find an opportunity of lecturing without the risk
of incurring loss anywhere save in Melbourne and Sydney. Were it
not for the ugly necessity of avoiding this calamity of financial loss, I
would soon try the spiritual temper of many another place besides these
two great centres ; but why I cannot do this, my readers may as readily j
surmise as I can describe.
In this city resides Mr. Alfred Deakin, the highly-gifted medium,
through whom what purports to be the spirit of John Bunyan has com¬
municated that most remarkable of our modern spiritual works, The j
New Pilgrim's Progress. I cannot say how this little volume may j
strike other readers, but to me its perusal recalls so forcibly the |
mentality and influence which breathe through the far-famed allegory of I
The Pilgrim's Progress, that every page seemed to bring me nearer and i
closer to the spirit of its author, until at last I felt as confident as I could
be of any point in Spiritualism, not proven by actual sensuous facts, j
that the spirit of John Bunyan breathes through every line of the more j
modern version; and although this partakes, as it should do, of all the
advanced thought, scientific perception, and enlarged views with which j
the mentality of the last half century is freighted, the conception and
execution of The New Pilgrim's Progress is redolent of John Bunyan—
John Bunyan the angel, the broad-brained, clear-eyed spirit ; the |
graduate of those nobler, grander Lyceums which constitute the school-
houses of heaven, and make its professors wise through all eternity.
The New Pilgrim's Progress is a noble work, and I rejoiced to find |
myself honoured by the presence of its talented and faithful mediumistic |
author as my chairman on the occasion of my first lecture in Melbourne.
Now, as on many other occasions, I take the opportunity of i
remonstrating with our spiritualistic allies on the apathy they manifest
in extending material support and mental devotion toward our spiritual j
literature. We, the Spiritualists, have the best, the most philosophical
and instructive literature in the world, and yet our journals die out by
scores for want of support, our writers are compelled to print their
works in the least attractive form, and at the highest possible rates, to
compensate for their limited circulation, and yet we number in the ranks
of actual believers at least five per cent, more than any other isolated
sect of religionists in the present century. Why is this ? Can the
solution of the problem only be found in the fact that our belief, our
phenomena and their results, come to us all too cheaply, and therefore
are proportionably undervalued ? I rather fancy this is the solution of
the difficulty. In this case, however, I would kindly suggest that how¬
ever freely and liberally spiritual gifts are bestowed, their record on
paper costs the usual amount to produce, whilst their propagandists,
whether speakers, writers, healers, or test mediums, have just as much
to pay for board, lodging, travelling expenses, &c., &c., &c., as other
mortals; consequently, if the dissemination of our ideas, facts, and
* From The Banner qf Light, May 11th.
literature is—as I firmly believe, nay, absolutely know—the best means
of redeeming mankind from all its errors of crime and ignorance, the
sooner those who have the means to pay its way get rid of the idea that
it costs nothing to receive, therefore ought to cost nothing to give, the
faster the world will progress in the soul saving and body-improving
faith taught and proved by the angels of the New Dispensation.
In closing these rambling remarks, let me offer a small tribute of justice
to Mr. Thos. Walker, a very unassuming, very young and unsophisticated
youth, whose admirable gifts as a trance speaker have awakened equal
astonishment and interest in every place where opportunities have
been afforded him to lecture. He is now in Melbourne holding a public
discussion with the Rev. — Green, a clergyman of well-known and
acknowledged ability as a scholar and finished speaker, yet a babe in the
hands of the humble, unsophisticated English peasant boy, who could
hardly hold a creditable conversation with him in private, but who, on
the rostrum, and under the influence of his “ guides,” makes the
reverend gentleman look so small, and his attempts at argument so
puerile, that those who best know him, and most value his reputation,
are most earnest in wishing the debate to close, and advising all other
reverend gentlemen to let those unquenchable Spiritualists alone.
I must add, also, that even when considered from its most discourag¬
ing point of view—that is, in respect to how much more might be done
if the means were at hand—the progress of Spiritualism in these colonies
is obviously on the increase, and already the combined efforts of Messrs.
Peebles and Walker have so fully prepared the way for my own lectures,
that I am less surprised than gratified to note the immense interest
which greets me everywhere, and especially to mention, as one sign of
the times, whichTias hitherto been insultingly blatant or significantly
silent, is sufficiently complimentary to me to assure me that even the
favourite contributor, Mrs. Grundy, has “ got religion,” and become
converted to Spiritualism.
THE PSYOEOLOGICAL REVIEW.
The following remarks are extracted from the preface to
the new Psychological Review
{< There was recently a discussion in a well-known review
on the influence of faith in a future life on morality, to
which intellectual athletes of all orders were invited, with
the deliberate exception of the Spiritualist. The editor’s
prescription seemed to be, Deny as you please, believe as
you please, conjecture as you please, but not a word of the
future life as matter-of-fact ! The Christian and anti-
Christian aversion from what are called ‘ ghosts ’ is beyond
understanding, and was tersely expressed by a rabid agnostic
who exclaimed, e Spiritualism is not for discussion; it is an
affair for the police ! ’
“ Spiritualism is no novelty, but omnipresent with man¬
kind. In Dr. Johnson’s words, c There is no people, rude or
learned, among whom apparitions of the dead are not related
and believed. The doubts of single cavillers can very little
weaken the general evidence; and some who deny it with
their tongues confess it with their fears.’ A Catholic of any
sincerity is a practical Spiritualist; he invokes the saints in
his perplexities, and by prayers and ceremonies hopes to
minister to the welfare of friends who have preceded him
within the veil. Protestantism does much to deaden the
lively sense of the relation between the outer and inner
worlds, but human nature is stronger than dogma, and in a
thousand ways vindicates its instincts. We need only ask
Churchman or Nonconformist to believe what he reads and
sings every Sunday of his life, and doing so, he will find
himself the Spiritualist he contemns.
“What is designated ‘Modern Spiritualism’ is the
attempt to discover and define our connections with the
inhabitants of the spiritual world. We are persuaded that
death is not extinction, but entrance to wider and happier
being ; that men and women survive as men and women in
a universe over and around us ; that our relations with them
are organic and indissoluble; that we feel and think together,
are inspired by them, and affect them; and that this per¬
petual and unobserved inter-communication is under certain
conditions convertible into open communication, which open
communication may be largely developed, and the unseen
world brought within range of common observation. These,
we' maintain, are articles of reasonable faith and hope,
verified by experience, and in course of verification; and
those engaged in the enterprise are justified in their
endeavour, and will achieve a notable service for mankind
when death as a barrier between the natural and spiritual
worlds is broken down, and throws no longer a gloomy
shadow over human life.”

THE SPIRITUALIST.
June 7,1878.
EASTERN PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENA.
BT J. M. PEBBLES, M.D. i/
A STKANGE SPIRITUAL PHENOMENON IN INDIA—THE CASTING OUT OP A j|
DEMON. | (
The Assistant Director of Public Instruction and Registrar of j
Assurances, Mr. D. S. White, of Madras, is a writer of considerable |
note, and, theologically speaking, an outright freethinker, with no j j
spiritualist proclivities; and yet he confessed that he had witnessed j)
marvellous phenomena, alleged to be spiritual, that sorely puzzled him; i <
and, among others, referred to the wonderful manifestations that ||
occurred in the presence of young Kelly, son of Mr. P. Kelly, a railway j j
contractor. Before leaving the city I visited Mr. Kelly, his son j(
Thomas, and Mr. Cronin, the brother-in-law, getting written state- j
ments from them in confirmation of the marvels referred to by Mr. j)
White. Reserving the written documents, I submit the following |
condensed statement. ’ |
The Kellys, Irish in descent, were a quiet, industrious family of i
Roman Catholics, residing at St. Thomas, some eight miles out from | (
the city of Madras. They had never heard of a people known as jj
Spiritualists. Mr. Kelly, having the supervision of some native Hindus j
employed upon the public works some distance from home, struck one I j
of these intractable natives with considerable violence. The Hindu was j)
terribly exasperated, and threateningly called upon his ancestral god | (
to palsy the arm or otherwise punish the man who had dealt him the I j
blow; and, strange to relate, almost immediately thereafter, and with- ! /
out any appreciable cause, painful swellings came upon the offending j \
arm. These for a time proved absolutely incurable, and then, all at |>
once, they went away, seemingly of themselves; but at the same time j)
his son Thomas became afflicted and annoyed by what could only be i {
attributed to superhuman agencies. j j
Perplexed and troubled, Mrs. Kelly wrote her husband of the strange j <
tilings occurring by invisible powers in the presence of this son, such as j \
stones dropping down before him, dishes sailing out of the cupboard ! /
and flying about the room, doors opening of their own accord, trunks !(
unlocked without keys, and some other things too odd to be mentioned. j ( j
Mr. Kelly replied to the letter in a rather harsh manner, reproving j) j
the wife and family for their superstition. But the noises increased ; J ( j
furniture was injured in locked rooms; crockery-ware was dashed to j j !
pieces before their eyes ; and a four-pound shot came crashing down j j
through the roof one evening, yet leaving no discoverable opening. i j
At this singular crisis of affairs Mr. Kelly sent for the son to come to j j j
him at once. He did so, and yet these inexplicable manifestations |(!
followed him. The son-in-law, Mr. Cronin, a well-educated man, still j j
remaining sceptical upon the spiritual origin of these troublesome j I
wonders, went personally with a carriage to convey the young man to 11!
his own house. On the way the carriage was struck several times by j (
some seemingly heavy weapon, stones fell into the carriage before their 111
own eyes, and also a marble paper-weight from his sister’s table.
The following is an extract from Mr. James Cronin’s lengthy state- |)
ment:— i
“ On the following day, April 30th, reaching my sister’s house about j j
10 a.m., I met my brother, who said, come quickly into the hall. I 1 j
went, and saw the whole of the books, usually in an open bookcase, j)
scattered about; some sticking to the roof of the room, and others hung j f
by the rafters on the roof; the Bible alone was left in the book-case, j j
This circumstance induced my brother to exclaim, ‘ I defy the spirits, or i j
whatever they may be, to meddle with that book 11 The challenge was j
accepted; for having replaced the books, and turning to go out of the j /
room, my brother felt a heavy shock at the back of his head, and j
wheeling around the Bible fell at his feet. . . . Soon a crucifix and a j!
stove were thrown into the hall. I now not only became convinced, but i)
timid; and accordingly I induced the young man to join a ‘ religious j (
order.’ . . . The supernatural phenomena continued, annoying us i)
especially when at prayers. Three priests were called in at one time, i)
but they could do nothing toward casting away these 6vil spirits. (
Valuable papers were taken from locked drawers and thrown about the )
room; property was destroyed; my brother was struck in the head, and
what caused more anxiety, it was plainly perceptible that he was grow- (
ing melancholy, nervous, and sickly. Sometimes he would fall into )
trance-like fits; and at these times he was strong as a Samson, but very \
weak after coming out of them. When in these trance states he would | (
talk Hindustani, but could not speak a word of it in his natural condi- j)
tion. . . ,x When in this state of stupor or trance I elicited from the | \
spirit that the young man’s father having struck a lubbay-caste man at j (
Virumputty, a place near Trichonopoly, a spell was put upon him. But j)
he being a healthy, strong-minded man, it did not have so much effect, ! j
and was therefore turned upon this young man. ... I laid hold of the I > i
young man, a struggle ensued by the door, and he awoke weak and ! |
exhausted.” ; (j
Finally, this family sent quite a distance for one of those self-sacri- i j
ficing, holy-minded Hindus, who it was said have the power to thwart all \\
diabolical influences, and cast out demons. He came, wearing a white, i j,
robe-like dress, and remained three days and three nights. The first I h
evening he marched around the house several times, carrying fire in his j |
hand, chanting sacred hymns and repeating prayers. He put the lad i |
in front of him the second night, burned perfumed paper, drew diagrams, ! j
anointed him, and had him put on a complete change of apparel. The i \
third and last night he placed a mesmeric circle by passes around his i (|
head, bathed him in soma-scented water, anointed him with holy oil, j /1
made him put on another entire suit of clothes, and repeating prayers, j (j
pronounced him, the family, and the house, relieved of all demoniacal | (j
influences. And from that hour nothing strange or superhuman I |
occurred. i j
I saw several members of the family, and also the young man, now |) j
about twenty, hale and healthy. He dislikes to talk about the diabo- j j |
Real influences that so long followed and infested him. I may further say, 111
that this old Hindu desired to and did take away with him all the cast¬
off garments that this young man had worn, and so did to burn them.
A portion of this extraordinary case of obsession was published in the
Madras News, May, 1874.
A SIVA TEMPLE—FRIDAY THE DEMON’S DAY.
Nestling among shady trees in the outskirts of Madras, is a Siva
Temple, presided over by a Coomarapa Mudliar. On Friday afternoon
of each week he casts out demons. Remaining in waiting by this temple
about half an hour, a group of friends brought an obsessed woman. She
looked wild, spare, skinny, and seemed nervous and sensitive.
“How,” I inquired, “does she appear, and what does she do at
home?”
The father replied : “ She has times of being stupid, and is irritable
and ugly. At other times her head rolls ; she falls into unconscious¬
ness, talks strangely in different tongues, and prophesies lies. She has
had this demon for four months.” The priest drew a circle on the stone
floor of the Temple, and sprinkled the enclosure with water. The
friends placed her in the centre of the circle, and holding the image of
a god before her, repeated prayers; then, placing his hand upon her
head, she became tremulous, spasmodic, and fell seemingly lifeless.
The priest evoked the presence of a good spirit to become her guardian.
She soon arose, and was pronounced well, to the great joy of her
friends.
NARRAIN SWANY NAIDOO AND HIS OBSESSED WIFE.
This man has been in the employ of Mr. Nicholas, a Madras photo¬
grapher, for several years. His wife, having had some serious difficulty
with a neighbouring woman about some fruit, became obsessed by a
demon-spirit.
“ Her head,” said the husband, “ would shake and whirl by the
hour. She grew dreamy and lazy. She fell into trances, spoke
different languages in as many voices, personated other individuals,
fell on the ground at times, and sometimes used improper words.”
“ What else did this devil-spirit make her do? and who was he when
on earth P ’’
“ He would not tell his name, but made her break things in the house,
and hold fire in her hands without being burned. Large branches of
trees would fall down before her, and a great stone lying outside the
fence was thrown over into the yard Other things were done
that I would not like to mention At last I took her to that
order of priests, or holy men, who have power over evil spirits.”
“ What did he do to disobsess her?”
“ He told her to go with another woman into a private apartment and
bathe herself in fresh water. He then took us into a new and well-
perfumed room, and had my wife sit down on a nice clean mat. He
then burned some camphor-gum on a flat brass dish, and while it was
burning he kept clapping his hands. He then prayed to the great God
of the universe, and, stamping, commanded the devil-spirit to go; and
he had to go.”
“ What assurance had you that he would not return and obsess her
again ?”
“ He could not, because the Guru, or priest, took a singular-shaped
piece of brass, and, making figures and devices upon it, he breathed his
breath into it and suspended it around her neck. And then he made an
offering to the cast-out demon, and invoked a good spirit to become her
guardian. She has been all right since.”—Banner of Light, May llth.
The Revue Magnetique says that M. le Baron du Potet is working
steadily at the compilation of his Memoirs. We hope to see them
published in a short time. The book will contain much interesting
matter concerning Mesmerism.
Religious Persecution.—In days when Mrs. Besant’s child is taken
from her because the mother acts up to her highest convictions, the
following paragraph from The Popular Science Monthly will be read
with interest. It shows the same diabolical spirit of ignorance and
persecution:—“ When he came in sight of the fatal pile, the wretched
Servetus prostrated himself on the ground, and for a while was absorbed
in prayer. Rising and advancing a few steps, he found himself in the
hands of the executioner, by whom he was made to sit on a block, his
feet just reaching the ground. His body was then bound to the stake
behind him by several turns of an iron chain, while his neck was
secured in like manner by the coils of a hempen rope. His two books-—
the one in manuscript sent to Calvin in confidence six or eight years
before for his strictures, and a copy of the one lately printed in Vienna
—were then fastened to his wrists, and his head encircled in mockery
with a chaplet of straw and green twigs bestrewed with brimstone. The
deadly torch was then applied to the faggots and flashed in his face;
and the brimstone catching, and the flames rising, wrung from the
victim such a cry of anguish as struck terror into the surrounding
crowd. After this he was bravely silent, but, the wood being purposely
green, a long half-hour elapsed before he ceased to show signs of life
and suffering. Immediately before giving up the ghost, with a last
expiring effort, he cried aloud, ‘ Jesus, thou Son of the Eternal God,
have compassion upon me 1’ All then was hushed saving the cracking
of the green wood; and by and by there remained no more of what had
been Michael Servetus but a charred and blackened trunk and a handful
of ashes. Thus perished a noble man of whom his age was not worthy
—the victim of murderous religious bigotry.”
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
R. — One of your letters is about a private matter, in which the publiejiavo
no interest. The other contains mysterious innuendos which readers would
not understand. In print, you should give clear plain statements.
Erratum.—In Mr. Desmond Fitz-Gerald’s recent paper the words “ domain of
physical dynamics ” should have been “ domain of psychical dynamics.”

THE SOUL OF THINGS, by William Denton. In
this extraordinary book the author, who is a Professor of
Geology in America, employed clairvoyants to reveal to him
by vision events connected with the early history of geological
specimens' these sensitives thus saw the Mastodon and other
extinct animals as if living and moving before them; they like¬
wise saw the scenes by which these prehistoric animals iwere
surrounded. The author also sent his clairvoyants to examine
portions of different planets, and they gave descriptions of the
inhabitants, physical geography, and vegetation of each. The
book is illustrated with numerous engravings, drawn by the
sensitives as the visions passed before their eyes. The substance
of a review of this book in “ The Spiritualist ” was to the effect
that there is no doubt as to the integrity of the author, who also
possesses sufficient inteliigence to select clairvoyants who would
not cheat him. The question as to the reliability of the narratives
therefore narrows itself down to the question of the reliability
of clairvoyance, which, when employed to gain information about
distant places on earth, has been found sometimes to give ac¬
curate results and sometimes inaccurate results. The review
urther expresses the opinion that if ever interplanetary com¬
munication should be established, it will be by means of clair¬
voyance or some other of the latent and little understood
spiritual powers in man. Three Yols. 24s.; or 8s. per single
volume.

Opinions oe the Press.
“As a dispassionate scientific man, he appears to have
investigated the subject without pre-conceived ideas, and the
result of his examination nas been to identify his opinions with
those of Messrs. Varley, Crookes and Wallace, in favour not
only of the absolute reality of the phenomena, but also of
the genuineness of the communications alleged to be
given by the spirits of the departed. Into the much vexed
question of d priori objections to Mr. Harrison’s opinions we
shall not now enter. We will only say that his descriptions of
facts are couched in a moderate and truly scientific spirit, that
he appears to have exhausted every reasonable test which his
experience led him to make, and that the whole tone of the
book (which is singularly free from dogmatic pretension) is
rigorously logical.”—Public Opinion.
“At the outset of his booklet Mr. Harrison disclaims any
intention of proselytising or forcing his opinion down non-
Spiritualistic throats, and it is only fair to admit that the
succeeding pages are remarkably free from argument and
deduction, albeit bristling with assertions of the most dumb¬
founding nature.”—London Figaro.
“ Although the author has taken some trouble to prove that
table-turning and spiritual appearances are worthy of more
attention than the public are disposed to give, yet we are so
far from being impressed by the evidence he has brought for
ward, that we acquit the spirits of mortals of performing any
of the nonsensical acts with which they are accredited.”—
Morning Advertiser.
“ The unprejudiced and dispassionate temper in which
Mr. Harrison seems to have approached the question, emi¬
nently fitted him to test the authenticity and the value of the
phenomena he undertakes to chronicle, and after a careful
perusal of his little booklet, we are bound to acknowledge that
the statement in his preface is fairly sustained. He neither
theorises nor dogmatises, nor attempts to make converts to
his views. He states occurrences and events, or what he be¬
lieves did really happen, in a remarkably clear and narrative
style, without any attempt at advocacy or argument. The
mode in which Mr. Harrison has discharged his task is praise¬
worthy; but what of the task itself? To those who areun-
acquamted with the pretensions of Spiritualism, and those so-
called, and to the majority, incredible manifestations of the
spirit world, which are the ordinary concomitants of the
system, the revelations contained in Spirit People will appear
startling and antecedently impossible.”—South Wales Daily

NEATLY PRINTED LEAFLETS
Containing instructions
HOW TO FORM SPIRIT CIRCLES AT HOME,
With no Spiritualist or Professional Medium present, may be
obtained at The Spiritualist Newspaper Branch Office, price
300 /or Sixpence, post free, or 500for Ninepence, post free.
These leaflets are specially suitable
FOR DISTRIBUTION AT PUBLIC MEETINGS,
And in localities where mediums and spirit circles are not
numerous.
The Spiritualist says:—“ Contention about Spiritualism and
mediums should be avoided, and action substituted. The real
strength of Spiritualism lies far more in its facts than in
clamouring about them; the facts, therefore, should be multi¬
plied by the wholesale dissemination of printed Information
how to form circles in the homes of private families. A pro¬
portion of those who receive the information will try experi¬
ments, and those who obtain the phenomena in their own
homes will at once irrevocably recognise as impostors or dis¬
reputably unsafe guides, those newspapers and individuals
who state authoritatively that the facts are not true. If every
Spiritualist makes it binding upon himself to “ drop about ” er
distribute five hundred of the leaflets, containing instructions
how to form spirit circles at home, the whole nation will be
deluged with useful information, and such a number of
mediums will spring up in private families, as to rapidly in¬
crease the knowledge of truths calculated to benefit in the
highest degree this materialistic, consequently irreligious age,’
THE SPIRITUALIST.

June 7, 1878.
A
NEW ERA.
H
OW TO PREVENT DISEASE AND PRE¬
MATURE DEATH BY NATURAL MEANS. '
T ORD BEAOONSFIELD justly stated the other
-Li day that “ the health of the people Is really the foundation
upon which all their happiness and power as a State depend.”
For the most practical mode of preventing desease and premature
death see a large Illustrated Sheet given with each bottle of
END’S ERUIT SALT. The information is invaluable. As a
HEALTH-GIVING, REFRESHING, COOLING, and INVIGO¬
RATING BEVERAGE, or as a gentle laxative and tonic in the
various forms of indigestion, use END’S FRUIT SALT (prepared
from sound ripe fruit). It is the best preventive and cure for
Biliousness, Sick Headache, Skin Eruptions, Impure Blood,
Pimples on the Face, Giddiness, Fevers, Feverishness, Feverish
Colds, Mental Depression, Want of Appetite, Sourness of. the
Stomach, Constipation, Vomiting, Thirst, &c., and to remove the
effects of errors of eating and drinking.
I^NO’S FRUIT SALT.—“Amongst the many
and varied medicinal discoveries of the nineteenth century
none, perhaps, has advanced so rapidly into public notice
as END’S FRUIT SALT. Comparatively unknown
some year or so ago, this preparation, which is made
from ripe sound fruit, is now met with in every quarter
of the globe. The great merit which is claimed for it is
that it keeps the blood pure and the system perfectly
clear, and thus takes away the groundwork of mala¬
rious diseases so common to towns and districts which
are ill-drained. There is little doubt but that the time
will eventually come when fevers and diseases resulting
from poisoned blood will be considered as offences
against the well-being of communities at large; but we
will, in all probability, be some while yet before it
shall have arrived at such a pitch of sanitary perfection.
Meanwhile, we cannot withhold a welcome to any
specific which may prove a means of preserving or restor¬
ing health. The simpler the better, so long only as it is
effectual. END’S FRUIT SALT has been found an
excellent corrective to the digestive organs, and in the
colonies, in India, and in South America, has a largely
increasing sale. It is better by far than “nips,” and
amongst the Good Templars—a numerous community all
over-the world—it is recognised not only as a refreshing
but also as a stimulating drink.”—European Mail, Nov. 1,
877.
E
WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO
KNOW.
'NO’S FRUIT SALT.—A Gentleman writes
^ “ Since I have used END’S FRUIT SALT night and
morning, my headaches, &c., have left me, and this after
suffering for above twenty years. You should make this
fact well known.”
NO’S FRUIT SALT.— A Lady writes: —
“Everything, medicine or food, ceased to act properly for
at least three months before I commenced taking it; the
little food I could take generally punished me or returned.
My life was one of great suffering, so that I must have
succumbed before long.”
WHAT EVERY TRAVELLING TRUNK AND HOUSEHOLD
IN THE WORLD OUGHT TO CONTAIN—A BOTTLE OF
ENO’S fruit salt,
AS A
GENERA]. LAXATIVE AND TONIC
IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OP INDIGESTION.
GUARANTEED TO BE PREPARED FROM SOUND RIPE
FRUIT.
The Fruit Salt Is one of Nature’s own products. It contains alt
the valuable saline constituents of Ripe Fruit in a portable,
agreeable, and simple form, and is in every respect as harmless
as the juices of fruits from which it is obtained.
In Pimples and Blotches on the Face, Sallowness of the Skin,
and Depression of Spirits, it is most useful, for not the least of its
recommendations is its resemblance to fruit in the natural way
n which it relieves the svstem of effete or poisonous matter,
which, if retained, poisons the blood; and its advantages over
fruit is that it can be always at hand when required. Its
preparation has been truly styled one of the triumphs of modern
chemistry. In hot or foreign climates it is' invaluable. It allays
nervous excitement, J and restores the nervous system to its
proper condition (by natural means). In the Nursery it is beyond
praise.  
ENO’S FRUIT SALT
s particularly valuable. No traveller should leave home without
a supply, for by its use the most dangerous forms of Fevers,
Blood Poisons, &c., are Prevented and Cured. It is, in truth, a
Family Medicine Chest in the simplest yet most potent form.
Instead of being lowering to the system, this preparation is, in
the highest degree, invigorating. Its effect in relieving thirst,
giving tone to the system, and aiding digestion is most striking.
ENO’S FRUIT SALT (one of Nature’s own
products) keeps the blood pure, and is thus ot itself one of
the most valuable means of keeping the blood free from
fevers and blood poisons, liver complaints, &c., ever
discovered. As a means of preserving and restoring
health, it is unequalled; and it is, moreover, a pleasant,
refreshing and invigorating beverage. After a patient
and careful observation of its effects when used, I have
no hesitation in stating that if its great value in keeping
the body healthy were universally known, not a house¬
hold in the land would be without it, nor a single
travelling trunk or portmanteau but would contain it.—
J. C. Eno.
ENO’S FRUIT SALT.—“ I am very much pleased
with your FRUIT SALT. I have fully proved its great
efficacy by its having entirely cured me of indigestion.”—
T. Wood, Jun., Tudor-road, Canterbury.
WORTHY OF NOTICE.—PALPITATION OF
THE HEART, caused by Liver Derangement and Indiges¬
tion, frequently called (or mistaken for) Heart Disease
“ On April 141 purchased a bottle of your FRUIT SALT,
not feeling very well at the time, and it had an effect that
Inever anticipated when I bought it. I had suffered more
erless, since the year 1841, from palpitation of the heart,
nut very badly during the last few years. The least thing
would produce it during the day, and at night my sleep
was very much disturbed. Strange to say, after the first
dose of FRUIT SALT, the dangerous, annoying, and
truly disagreeable symptoms of palpitation suddenly
ceased, and have not since returned. Outof gratitude for
the benefit which I have received, I have recommended it
to all my friends, both in London and Yarmouth. At the
same time, I feel it a duty to state the above facts, of
which you can make whatever use you please. — I am,
dear sir, yours respectfully, “ W. B. Beckett,”
Aug. 30,1877—10, York-square, Commercial-road, London, E.

Capsule is marked “ ENO’S FRUIT SALT.” Without it
you have been imposed on by a worthless imitation. TRADE

Opinions op the Press.
From The Morning Post.
The Morning, Post, which strongly recommends the book in a
review nearly a column long, says“ Comic literature which
honestly deserves the epithet seems to be rapidly becoming a
thing of the past; consequently any writer who, like Mr. Harrison,
exhibits a genuine vein of humour, deserves the praise of all who
are not too stupid to enjoy an innocent laugh. Not that his muse
restricts herself only to such lighter utterances; on the contrary,
some of his poems touch on the deepest and most sacred feelings
of our common humanity... . The unfortunate Hadji’s narrative
of his adventures amongst the magicians of Whitechapel is quite
one of the funniest things that has been published for years. ...
The book contains quite enough to ensure it a welcome from
which its tasteful appearance will not detract.” The Morning
Post says of The Wobblejaw Ballads:—“ No’ one can help laughing
at them,” and it says that the rhymes are pitched in “ something
like the same key” as The Bon Gaultier Ballads or The Biglow
Papers, “with an appreciably successful result.”
From The Court Journal.
“All are of marked ability.... Occasionally we find verse of
great beauty, showing that the author possesses the pure poetic
gift.’’
From The Graphic.
“ Those who can appreciate genuine, unforced humour should
not fail to read The Lazy Lays and Prose Imaginings. Written,
printed, published and reviewed by William H. Harrison (38, Great
Russell-street). Both the verses and the short essays are really
funny, and in some of the latter there is a vein of genial satire
which adds piquancy to the fun. The Lay of the Newspaper Editor
is capital, if rather severe, and so is The Lay of the Macebearers;
but one of the most laughable bits is the Turk’s account of how he
went to be photographed.”
From Public Opinion,
“ A volume of remarkably good verse.... Some of the metrical
legends remind us of the wild chants that used to be sung at the
meetings of the Cannibal Club, some ten or fifteen years ago. Mr.
Harrison, however, knows where to plant his fun, and an accu¬
rate scientific mind like his can make jokes with success.... To
all who wish to read a pleasant volume magnificently got up as a
gift-book, we commend The Lazy Lays.”
From The Bookseller.
“An odd but most entertaining assortment of quaint and
humorous fancies, some in verse and others in prose, and all
written with a fluent and not ungraceful pen. The vein of
humour which permeates them is genuine, rich, and original, and
not at all ill-natured.”
From Nature.
Scientific men and matters are in one or two cases alluded to,
and the imprint bears that the work is published ‘a.d. 1877
(popular chronology); a.m. 5877 (Torquemada) ; a.m. 50,800,077
(Huxley).’ We believe that our readers may derive a little
amusement from a perusal of the volume.” .
From The British Journal of Photography.
The Lazy Lays include many admirable pieces, some of which
are in verse and others in prose, some scientific, others social, but
all of them excellent.... The Lazy Lays will make excellent and
amusing reading for an occasional spare half-hour.... They con¬
tain nothing unrefined or in bad taste.”
From The Dublin University Magazine.
“ How Hadji A1 Shacabac, an amiableTurk, was photographed,
is well done.... Bound in a cover of somewhat powerful design.”
From The Photographic News.
“Mr. W. H. Harrison, a gentleman whose name is familiar in
connection with photographic and other scientific literature, has
considerable facility of versification, and deals, in pleasant and
humorous mood, with many scientific’ follies which are better
laughed down than gravely disputed.”
From The Scotsman.
“ In Mr. W. H. Harrison’s Lazy Lays and Prose Imaginings
there is a good deal of broad humour and satiric power, with a due
foundation of solid sense."
From The Bradford Daily Chronicle.
“ Good poetical diction is displayed. Mr. Harrison has produced
a most welcome book.. .‘How Hadji al Shacabac was Photo¬
graphed,’ will be sure to make every reader roar with laughter.”
From The Dundee Daily Advertiser.
“ With such a free and easy author it is naturally to be expected
that his subjects should bear some trace of this peculiar idiosyn¬
crasy, and indeed they are as free and easy as himself.... The
poems are all characterised by smoothness and rhythmical swing.
... The Work is very elaborately bound in cloth and gilt.... A
gorgeous design upon the cover.... If our readers wish to en-
courage laziness they have a most deserving object in a very
clever and versatile member of the order.”
From The Liverpool Daily Courier.
“ In his handsomely bound and griffin-guarded Lazy Lays, Mr.
William H. Harrison provides a gift-book elegant in its appear¬
ance and entertaining in its contents.... The author is imbued
with the true spirit of humour, and amuses all while offending
none.”
From The Western Daily Press (Bristol).
“ A volume from the versatile pen of Mr. W. H. Harrison, a
well-known contributor to the London and provincial press, and
editor of The Spiritualist.. .. Many of the humorous poems re¬
mind us of the Ingoldsby Legends. The Lay of the Photographer
The Lay of the Macebearers, and some of The Wobblejaw Ballads
would not have been unworthy of Barham himself. Some of the
shorter poems are exquisite, and there pervade the whole a reli¬
gious sentiment and poetic feeling which will make them accept¬
able to most readers.
From the daily Northern Whig (Belfast).
“ The finest thing in the book is ‘How Hadji Al Shacabac wag
Photographed,’ It is an admirable addition to our not too ex¬
tensive comic literature. The story is one of which extracts
would not give an adequate idea; it is intensely humorous....
Those who wish to obtain a handsome gift-book of an amusing
nature, wijl find what they want to The Lazy Lays."
From The Bristol Daily Post.
“A curious collection of verses'and prose essays of unequal
merit.... The serious and sentimental verses belong to the type
of Mrs. Hemans’s or L E. L.’s productions.”
From The Kensington News.
It is “ after the manner of Barham, Hood, Mark Twain, or any
of those merry souls who do quite as much good in their day and
generation as the authors of the most serious works. The Lays
are always original, sometimes'serious, generally comic, but
never vulgar.”
From The Malvern News.
“It is in itself a work of itself—original, and a cast of its
author’s mind. It is a work of great power and beauty; full of
lively imaginings and bold outspoken thoughts, abounding in
tenderness and pathos; sparkling with wit and humour; and one
that may be read many tin? es over... The get-up of the book is
very handsome.” •
From The Folkestone News.
“A number of clever sketches and poems, among the latter
being a series of papers entitled The Wobblejaw Ballads, which
appeared in the columns of this paper a short time ago,
anl (Yhich created such a furore at the time.” \N.B. An
irirje member of the Town Council officially called the attention of
the Mayor and Corporation of Folkestone to the burlesques m the
“ Wobblejaw Ballads," but the members assembled laughed at the *
matter, and proceeded to the next business. The Mayor said that he
did not mind them.\ ... “ It contains some very choice poems
and prose essays, isoound in cloth richly gilt,and has an original
design of no ordinary merit on the cover.”
